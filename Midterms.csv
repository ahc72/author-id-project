BlakeIsBlake,"I think it would be disingenuous not to also consider that most of the flipped districts were wealthier suburban districts that expressed a dislike of Trump and the current Republican party.

With Gillum, O’Rourke, and Abrams, you’re essentially asking an entire state to vote a referendum on it’s views towards each party. Many different districts and corresponding demographics are in play for each race.

Additionally, I’m not so sure that the latter three candidates are the most progressive to begin with."
SDS1995,"While Gillum was definitely disappointing, Abrams and Beto put up some of the best statewide performances by a Democrat that those states have seen in years. If you ran a more centrist version of Abrams/Beto, I don't believe they'd have done as well last night. 

Going forward, at least speaking from an image standpoint, it'll be hard to tell where they fall. I think it's dependent on whomever wins the nomination in 2020. If it's someone like a Biden then I think you see several statewide nominees hitch themselves to him and a more left-of-center campaign. If it's someone like Bernie or Warren then I think you see more statewide nominees run campaigns further left than usual"
EngelSterben,"Here is the problem, areas are all going to be different, I don't think it's a one-size fits approach to how Democrats should run. What works in one state, might not work in another. The Democrats that run need to figure out the message they need to win that state/district and just go with it. If it's being more progressive, so be it. If it's running more left of center, so be it, but I woudn't just say ""This is the idea you need to run with no matter what"", I don't think it will ever be that simple."
Dolphman,"The Senate was a bloodbath for the Center, most of them didn't even come close.

Joe Manchin is now the last Blue Dog standing, I think Sherrod Brown types are the only way to win the midwest now. This is coming from a person who just lost their only real voice in the senate last night (Joe Donnelly). Now Sherrod Brown isn't some hyper #AbolishIce coastal Democrat, but he does represent that good old fashioned worker-lovin, union-supporten populists politics are the way to go in the midwest.



In Florida, Bill Nelson, a middling democrat lost alongside Gillum.

Things aren't nearly as conclusive as this post makes it out to be.
"
Noobasdfjkl,"I really, really, **really** don't think that's the takeaway here. O'Rourke probably would have done worse had he run to the center. Donnelly, Nelson, Heitkamp, McCaskill would have probably done better if they had voted for Kavanaugh. Gillum might have won had he been more moderate on guns. Abrams is probably a victim of voter suppression. Bredesen got crushed as a very center Dem, and may have done better as a true liberal. I don't know about Sinema (expecting she loses). Billie Sutton made ND decently competitive with his pro-life, pro-2A anti-corruption stance. Tester is gonna win with his low-key liberal (but soft on gun reform) stance but ""is-actually-a-farmer"" shtick. 

There's no one thing you can say is what the Democrats should do in 2020. As almost always, it's more nuanced than that, and you still have to run these senate races on a state-by-state basis. 

I railed against any Democrat (as well as Collins and Flake) who voted for Kavanaugh. With the exception of Tester, every single Dem in a battleground state that voted no has lost. Now, I'm not so sure it was worth the losses in the senate. 

What I think is the nuttiest thing about this midterm is that left-y ballot initiatives had a great night. That shows that really, candidates are the problem, and not a vague over-left-ification of the Democratic party as a whole. "
PM-ME-GIS-DATA,"Beto did better than any other statewide candidate in TX, largely thanks to his charisma and ground game, but I am sure he wouldn't have generated as much Dem enthusiasm if he was a centrist. He generated excitement by supporting the protesting NFL players, condemning the tent city, etc, but he does so because he is eloquent. I imagine his stance on gun control cost him votes here and there (i.e. supporting an assault weapons ban rather than just supporting improved background checks) but I don't know how many young or people of color wouldn't have turned out to vote if he didn't appear to be tough on gun control. I need data for this.

Haven't followed the FL-GOV race closely but I heard Gillum started going moderate in the last weeks before the election - argument goes that he could've instead fired up the base to increase turnout. 

Joe Manchin seems special as Joe Donnelly apparently ran closer to the center but was wiped out in the first hour of live results. There's more at play than policy stances."
abnrib,"Lots of people talking about moderates losing in the Senate, but it's the moderates who were winning the districts that gave the Democrats the House. 

The swing areas of the country are the suburban voters, high income and highly educated. That's where the moderate Democrats are needed."
GuaranteedAdmission,"Ok, so I spent all day yesterday outside my (swingy) voting precinct handing out sample ballots and talking to voters, so what I saw was the following:

* Republican voters interest was up from 2014. Democratic voter interest was up significantly more, but it didn't look like people stayed home

* The Democrats who won received more votes than there were registered Democrats - and they would not have won without those votes. Quite a few of these were Republicans who made it clear they were voting against Trump, and would be bailing the moment liberals did liberal things

* The winning Democrats made an investment in the ground game that the Republicans did not (or could not) match

So, *for my precinct*, a centrist is going to generate the most interest

There are 174k precincts, each of which have their own story to tell. The candidates I supported were focused on local issues and pretty much ignored

You're not going to find an answer that is going to apply universally. 

*That being said*, 2020 is basically going to be a referendum on Trump, less than whatever policies the Democratic nominee brings forward. Having some great ideas is awesome; they were completely irrelevant in 2016.

The best candidate for the Democrats in 2020 is going to be whomever is most able to compete against Trump. That may be a *very* different answer than the best candidate in 2024"
PoliticallyFit,"In terms of the Presidency, I think it's clear that 2020 will require a cadidate that can win the Rust Belt. Pennsylvania , Michigan, and Wisconsin all elected Democratic Governors last night. Those three states would have flipped the Presidency. Finally, all were won by moderate Democrats.

I think it's clear that 2020 will require a moderate Rust Belt candidate to beat Donald Trump. However, I don't think that Beto is necessarily not the guy out of those named. Sherrod Brown looks like a really good possibility though."
thatuiowaguy,"I think this question is premature still- give a week for the data people to shift through what was up with this election, who turned out, and for the election results.

Secondly- are you talking about individual candidates or the national party at large? Vastly different answers from me at least depending on what we're talking about."
NeibuhrsWarning,"“Run” to Center as a party? Definitely not.  More Blue races will continue pushing left as the electorate wants. But nationally I think the narrative of a leftist revolution reshaping the Party and the nation was discredited by the 2018 primaries and results. In many areas of the country, far left candidates are a mismatch for the electorate. And it’s time to stop trying to push a platform on those areas from safe blue areas that the voters aren’t comfortable with. "
ManBearScientist,"The best strategy for the Democrats going forward is to run Representatives that match their district, try to always win the House, and accept that the Senate isn't for Democrats.

As long as Senate races are party referendums, the GOP *cannot* lose.  There simply are more GOP states.  The increased partisanship is their shield and their sword in Senate races.  The Democrats might try to backtrack towards centrism, but partisanship is stoked by both parties and the GOP can simply keep hostilities high from their end to avoid bad outcomes.

The real fact of the matter is that the Democrats are trying to steal Senate seats for Texas, North Dakota, West Virginia, Missouri.  It is a massively uphill battle when partisanship is lower and a cliff when it is high.  They will always be on the defense, defending themselves on Republican territory.  Trump won 30 states; that's 60 Senator spots that favor the GOP.

Democrats probably have lost the Judiciary and the Senate until the next political realignment.  But they need to do their best job to steal upsets in local and district elections and put forth strong Presidential candidates.  "
Specter54,"When you draw national strategy from statewide elections you often find the conclusions you want to find:

* If you want more progressive candidates - use Donnelly and Nelson's defeats and point to Brown's victory.

* If you think moderate candidates are the path to victory - Manchin and Casey won, while Gillum lost with less votes than Nelson.

Your strategy needs to fit the demographics of that area."
Dr_V97,"TL:DR

Take notes from Manchin but build on those that almost won and those who surprised (Kansas)

&#x200B;

Apologies if this has been said before, but three influential Blue Dog democrats (Heitkamp, Donnely, McCaskill) lost in Trump supporting areas for treading a more centrist line. However the actions of Gillum, O'Rourke and Abrams are all within the South, areas typically taken by economically left-leaning (historically-pre-Nixon) and social moderate or conservative.

Due to demographic change as well as a distaste for a certain brand of politics they did far better than expected. However long standing loyalties and an energised Trump base caused victory, the same is true in the UK (my home nation) people may support a left leaning politician (see Ed Miliband) but the fear of what happens if they get in energises people's preference towards what they know. See the 2015 election in the UK where the polls predicted a hung parliament but fear of an SNP-Labour alliance led to a Tory victory.

 

In regards to the final question, on the coast the Democrats don't need to adjust but they need independant messages for certain states (see Manchin in WV). An ideal candidate for somewhere like the Midwest or the rural communities of the South would be a candidate who is not scared to attack the establishment but also defend the ideas of the DP. You deserve good healthcare, because we live in the best country. Attack the Republicans using their own ideas. They attack liberals for being weak on crime, attack them for being weak on removing the risk to children due to poverty, neglicence or crime. Fight rhetoric with policy which helps the communities. My hope for this party is they will get behind a strong candidate for 2020 who will defend the founding ideals of the modern Democratic Party, that government is there to help. The ideal ticket for 2020 is Biden/ Harris with Biden to last 1 term and be replaced by Harris/ O'Rourke. O'Rourke should stand in 2020 for governor to at least try to run a large state run campaign. I would like Cory Booker but I think a mixed ticket Moderate/ Progressive is the best way to go, Biden is a fantastic campaigner and has the working class routes and belief in American Exceptionalism to beat Trump and Harris can mobilise that fantastic Progressive movement with believes that America needs to wake up and smell the coffee on lots of important issues."
NostraSkolMus,We need to ease gun control stance. Too many people vote republican purely on that issue. 
olcrazypete,"As it stands now, Abrams is 60k down.  That may close some once all is counted.  The math in Georgia over last few cycles has been GOP wins by 200k.  As it is now, she cut that by half.  I haven't looked at raw vote totals but I'd be willing to bet she got the 200k extra dems to come out she needed.  She kept polls tight all the way thru, previous more moderate Dems have been tight thru a few weeks out then the republicans quit flirting with them and go home.   The republicans, though, were triggered badly.  Strong black female progressive is like Obama and Pelosi had a baby, and she spoke better than both of them.   Georgia GOP went full dirty over last weekend, full out black panthers support Abrams stuff.  They got their base to come out even harder.  Yet, she's still this close.  She did better than the white dem Lt Gov candidate who did run a more business friendly centrist thing .  The white moderate dem SoS candidate looks like he's made a runoff but only because of a stronger showing by the Lib candidate.    

What running someone like her did as well - the Dem base came out and worked.  Literally county parties restarted this cycle.  We weren't begging progressive base types, the most willing and active canvassers and workers, to work for her. They were excited to do it.   

And the thing is, she was progressive -but at this point a progressive platform is much more moderate in my mind than the normal conservative platform.   Medicaid expansion isnt' that controversial.  Some level of gun safety reform is not that controversial.  She had a platform, vs milktoast GOP-lite .   "
teknos1s,Neither. State by state district by district basis and judgment call. No litmus tests. No gate keeping. I personally want to see more pro gun democrats (as a liberal gun owner myself) 
raustin33,"I don't think the Dems should do anything with a broad brush. Largely where they've had success, it's been when they've focused on matching candidates to their local environment. 

Manchin won because he's Manchin. He's a perfect fit for WVA. Same with the polar opposite: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She won her primary because she's the right fit for that district. 

The Dems, IMO, only win with a big tent, that includes the Blue Dogs and the Ocasio-Cortezs, and everyone in between.

How that ladders up to one Presidential candidate, I have no idea. But they're going to have to be OK with blue dogs if they ever want the Senate back. And until the House is redrawn in more fair maps, same goes for the House. "
son_nequitur,"As long as Democrats are running back and forth between ""Left"" and ""Right"" ideas they will just be trading seats with Republicans forever.

Democrats need a return to principles if they want to begin the decades long period of control that will be required to correct our course on climate change, health care, criminal justice, and relations with Mexico and the muslim world.

That requires deep, open conversations about what liberalism really is, which the left is currently not prepared to have. Right now it's basically just a bumper sticker gameshow. As if somehow saying ""all the right things"" is the same as being a capable leader who can truly connect with the electorate. It's not."
CrzyJek,"If Democrats gave up gun control they would sweep both houses every election. I'm talking don't even touch the topic. Guns aren't a single issue for progressives, Democrats, or even left leaning independents And those voters will always vote their party. But they ARE a single issue for many moderate republicans and right leaning independents...and even some southern Democrats...not to mention libertarians.

Beto would have won Texas if he didn't have ""ban the AR-15"" as part of his platform. It's Texas for crying out loud. And Ted made a big deal out of it, and in the end I bet thousands showed up to the polls out of fear of losing their weapons.

And now you have Ted. Think of all the other good things Beto may have accomplished.

Now repeat that across the nation."
MoldTheClay,How about Dems in red states stop running on a gun control platform?
EnigmaTrain,"Just a few thoughts on center v. progressive platforms.

* In FL, Nelson and Gillum couldn't have been more different in terms of identity and platform, but they performed about the same. Shows that progressive platform, at the very least, does not hurt.
* In TX, Beto got much closer than Cruz's 2012 opponent did, with a very progressive platform (narrowed it from 56-40 to 51-48)
* It seems like the draconian immigration rhetoric didn't help many Republicans who run hard on immigration policy. Steve King almost lost his seat, and that district was +30 R in his previous election. We might see an end to Trump's dangerous caravan rhetoric, or at least hear less of it.
* Nick Malinowski won NJ-7 (my childhood district) over Leonard Lance, who is ostensibly one of the most moderate Republicans. NJ-7 went 49-48 for Hillary in 2016. I would say Malinowski had a liberal platform with some progressive elements. "
nocomment_95,"I think what this shows is that charisma matters, and you show that by having bold vision, and being eloquent about it. Centrism isn't really bold."
acidroach420,"It was a mixed bag for all the Democrats and individual races can be flipped for many structural reasons. My takeaway isn't that the centrist Dems won, though. Look at McCaskill, Donnelly, Heitkamp, and potentially Tester...all the most moderate Dems in the Senate, lost. Meanwhile, Sherrod Brown kept his seat while Cordray lost, and the minimum wage bill won in MO despite McCaskill's loss. The narrative is in no way clear cut but I don't think you can say either the centrists or the more progressive wing won out. 

The big takeaway is that the parties are polarizing even further, so running ""Republican lite"" candidates in 2020 would be foolhardy."
RosieRedditor,"No. That would move the center further and further right as the right gets more and more extreme, as it has been doing. Hell No! "
jeffdrafttech,"I’m a red state democrat. The recipe is easy. 

Ignore gun regulation. Achieve an A+ NRA rating. For most blue collar men, this is a requirement and the #1 reason they choose one candidate over another. 

Pay attention to foreign trade. Blue collar people are from families who have moved from middle class to poverty due to the exporting of manufacturing beginning in the 90s and increasing dramatically around 2000. There is some middle ground between Trump and Clinton and we need to find it. When Trump is the only one talking about it, he will win. "
cult_of_da-bits,"The Abrams race should be completely invalidated and redone and run by an independent commission. Purging voter rolls, the guy running for governor also overseeing the election, can you say the fox watching the chicken coop? Fuck that. "
Swayze_Train,"Coming to terms with what middle Americans want is what the Democratic party needs to do, they need to once again become the Big Tent party that anybody from any walk of life can feel they have a place in...but not the way you're imagining.

In 2016 one of Trump's most damaging strategies was his ""better jobs"" rhetoric. Among working class voters, the abysmal wage situation has primed them to be responsive to poverty-fighting talk. Trump took advantage of that, and as Clinton was seen as a corporatist and a puppet of the financial sector and Wall st, Trump was able to ironically take the initiative on addressing poverty.

Moving to the center when it comes to wealth redistribution or progressive tax structures or social support is not going to produce results. Voters are more receptive to poverty fighting politics than ever.

Where Democrats need to compromise with voters is in the social arena. Democratic politics has become so focused on racial and social justice that, to a conservative, it seems downright hateful. Their championing of special social groups above all others has made voters that aren't of those special social groups feel they aren't valued by Democrats. You can't say that this group or that is of greater importance without sending the message that other groups are of lesser importance, and that drives people away. Voters respond to emotional needs, and they need to feel that Democrats aren't going to overlook them just because they're not of a special group.

Thus, Biden is exactly the wrong direction to move in. While he may be conservative insofar as he worships money and disdains the poor, he uses social justice to shore up his liberal image. He has exactly the wrong priorities. You need a candidate like Sanders...if you could reach back to 2016 and pull *that* Sanders out. Currently, Sanders is diving head first into divisive social justice politics and focusing on championing special groups instead of championing *everybody*.

Social justice has poisoned the Democrats. There's no place in their narrative for the common man."
a_real_snek,"Beto and Abrams came *very* close in states that are traditionally seen as deep red, much closer than ""moderate"" Democrats have come in past years. We also saw moderate incumbents lose in North Dakota, Indiana, and Missouri. I'm already very tired of this narrative.

The truth about tonight is that there's bits of evidence that anyone could use to support their favorite hottest take, but if you take the sum of the Governor and Senate races, it's apparent that progressives over-performed and moderates under-performed according to what conventional wisdom about what an ""electable Democrat"" in those states looks like. Seriously - a Democrat coming within 2.5 points statewide in Texas is a goddamn miracle."
GobiasBlunke,"National narratives on state level elections create false expectations. 

"
teerexbc,"I think what is happening right now is that America is experiencing an electoral shift. Some deep red states such as Arizona, Texas, and Georgia have seen Democrats make decent gains . They may not have won but all came very close. Formerly swingy/bluish states such as Ohio, Missouri, and (possibly) Florida have shifted more right. "
harrison_wintergreen,"the blue wave turned out to be one of the strongest mid-term elections for the party of a sitting president. at this same time in Obama and Clinton's first terms, the Dems lost far more seats in Congress than the GOP lost yesterday.

"
OhioTry,"I hope that this convinces the Democratic Party that centrism is the way to win.  But I would not be surprised to see the DSA double down on a bad idea.  

Full disclosure, I supported Sanders in the 2016 primary, though I never seriously expected him to win. I've repented of leftism and swung back to the center."
GotMoFans,The lesson is you excite your base being progressive enough to get them excited to vote in bigger numbers and hope independents latch on to your innovative ideas to make the community better. 
flightpay,"I don't think there is an easy answer here. On the one hand, some far left candidates ran close races and tough states. On the other hand, there were other factors at play (like Cruz being outrught unpopular)

Another example is Florida. The centrist Senator candidate is losing by a smaller margin than the more liberal governor candidate

I think what is clear with the wins in the House however is that Democrats are strongest when they don't have a national image or national purity test and instead can run local candidates who reflect the local constituency.

In fact, I would argue that because the Democrats lost so many state-level races, it's a sign that their national image is a bit more problematic four candidates that have to win a whole state than someone voting for a Democratic candidate near them. "
Rogscope,"Unfortunately, it seems like a moderate candidate wouldn't energize their base enough. Also, people won't vote for you over the aisle.

 This is the consequence of a highly polarized political landscape. Partisan rhetoric will continue to experience growth.

To answer your question; no, Democrats will not move to the center. They will move even further left with rhetoric and possibly policy."
B1gWh17,Because legislating from the center has worked so well for them then in the past? 
Clownshow21,"God, the democrats can't ever be centrist. They may try to claim that they are ""centrist"" but don't let them fool you. With the way they have acted and what they talk about it seems they'll continue to divide based on the intersectional identity politics they are playing, this is of course especially today a winning strategy, because most of the universities and other sources will teach kids intellectual rot like this and transform them into a new thinker who thinks bigger government is the answer, if you are a sane person how could you ever actually think bigger government is better. This is why the young vote to them is so good, cause kids are idiots quite frankly.

They'll continue on the trend that's been set and you can see on the midterm voter map results, the coasts and urban centers are being indoctrinated to believe in big government more and more, but trump being trump certainly didn't help either. But to trumps credit he has revealed either purposely or on accident how crazy the democrats really are. "
mikey-likes_it,It depends on the district. Democrats need to be progressive in progressive areas and more blue dog in conservative. This is why we are looking at Connor Lamb returning from PA and a freshman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from Harlem. 
TomeryKY,"Nah. If I had to rank it, i would trust a compromise between the center-left and the actual left to do best for 2020. After that a legit leftwinger and THEN a boring centerist.

I feel like it just all depends on whoever comes out of the primary though. Maybe will get a real charismatic centrist, or a boring turd of a leftist."
rightsidedown,"I think Dems need to run people closer to Jon Tester in the midwest and south, for statewide races, but they can get more progressives in house and local legislature spots.

IMO gun rights in particular are costing too many votes in tight races. 


"
sofaboii,"I feel like you're cherry picking data a little bit -- Heitkamp and Donnely ran to the center and LOST re-election. I think no canidate had a chance against Cruz, although Beto performed remarkable well. I doubt a centerist candidate could have garnered the hype and attention that his campaign recieved."
AndyChrono,"I wouldn't say run to the center, but the lesson IMO is to remember that the Democrats are a big tent party and that the center is part of that tent.

The losses of McCaskill, Heitkamp, Donnelly, Bredsden, Beto, etc. don't really say much one way or another because they were all in deep red states. ANY Democrat - whether they are progressive or centrist - would have been hard pressed to win in those states. Similarly, the victory of someone like Ocasio-Cortez in New York doesn't really say much either since that's a deep blue district.

The loss of both Nelson and Gillum in Florida also doesn't give much indication one way or another since both the establishment and progressive candidates lost.

On the flip side, Manchin and Tester managed to hold on. Also, the Democrats ran the table on GOP held districts that Clinton won in 2016 and they did it by running moderates that could appeal to the more college educated suburban communities. Maybe bleeding heart liberals could have done the same, but there's a difference between ""maybe doing it"" and actually doing it - and the moderates did it this time in those battleground Congressional Districts.


The progressive wing has been the source of an enormous amount of activism and energy the last two years, and the Dems should definitely continue to cultivate that. However, it should not be at the expense of the center. The Dems are going to need folks like Manchin, Tester, and all the new class of suburban Congressmen/women if they want to keep their majority in the House and take back the Senate and Presidency in 2020."
BlackCatsAreMagic,"No.

Ted Cruz won by 2 points last night against a true Progressive.  He beat a centrist Neo-Lib in 2012 by 16.

The evidence is clear. If Dems want to win, they need progressive policies and candidates."
RadicalOwl,"They should stay left on economic issues, but leave all the radical identity politics behind. Political correctness appeals to a very small minority on the left. If dems stopped talking about all the oppressed people, and instead focused on a positive message for most americans (regardless of race and gender), they would win most elections. "
spqr-king,"Where the democrats are is already the middle in the minds of most people who would consider themselves progressive. They need to run the right candidate for the right races. If its a deep blue district dont stick a blue dog in there and if its a red district why would you choose someone hyper progressive on gun legislation or abortion? All this election shows is that our nation is even more divided between suburbs and urban areas and the rural areas. PA was redistricted to be fair and look at the massive change what happens if North Carolina was forced to do that as well? Or if Georgia took voters rights seriously? Theres no reason to run anywhere they just need to continue to keep people energized and fight for the values they were individually elected on. That means those who said they would vote no to Nancy Pelosi need to do that and those who said they would fight for the second amendment need to do that while pushing for medicare for all and improving education among other progressive policy points.

&#x200B;

Also side note Wexton is not a moderate if northern VA wanted a ""moderate"" Comstock would have won. Spanberger won in a formerly deep red area so I   am not sure its dems who should be running to the center."
This_charming_man_,"No, I think this race shows directly the opposite.
Democrats have been losing across the board for the last few years by not sticking to the principles that define the party; the common good.
Also, the republicans have been running an effective campaign against de1mocrats declaring the inneffectualism which stems from there centerist platform.
There is enough headwind behind far left politicians that any call for a more centered party is tonedeaf.
Get enough far left politicians through the traditionally democratic states and the change will be even more apparent"
DisparateNoise,"No? You only think this because you were paying special attention to the Progressive race (Beto, Gillum, et all) but the centrist races weren't that good either. Mccaskill practically went all the way to the right in Missouri and lost worse than either Beto or Gillum.

The thing about ""going center"" is that the center is inherently fickle in the short term and unreliable in the long run. There is no competition for the left flank - if Democrats motivate that side of the debate then they'd never have to worry about it abandoning them.

'Moderate' Republicans have been poisoned to the idea of voting Democrat. They may dislike Trump, but they also dislike taxes and gun control, so they just sit out. Are Democrats willing to become the party of lower taxes and lower gun control? If not then the center-right will never be competitive territory. "
tachynic,"I think the lesson from last night is not as easy as ""progressivism failed."" Progressives were successful in deep blue districts--Ocasio-Cortez and Pressly are two examples. But in red/purple districts and states they largely were rejected--see, e.g., O'Rourke, Gillum, Eastman, Ojeda, Abrams, and Bryce. It is also interesting to me the Democratic senators that lost (McCaskill, Donelly, Heitkamp, Nelson--with Tester fighting for his life) all voted against Kavanaugh. Manchin voted for him and sailed through.

So maybe ""run to the center"" vs. ""run to the left"" is a false choice. I think the question is more: on *which issues* should Democrats move to the center? And on *which issues* should Democrats move to the left? And who should these issues be framed? In other words, **what should the overall message of the Democratic party be?**

Because Democrats have a *national* image problem. They can win when they localize races, as in the moderates who were successful in wealthy Romney-Clinton suburban districts around the country. But this national image problem tanks them in big Senate races like Missouri, Indiana, North Dakota, Texas, Florida, Arizona, possibly Montana. In those red/reddish-purple areas, the Democrats taking sides in the culture war is a big problem. There are a lot of red states, and states are what you need to win the Senate majority or become president.

At the same time, another lesson from last night is geographical. The Southeast cannot be relied on to give Democrats wins, but the Midwest is ready to vote for the right candidate. So with that in mind, here's what I think a good 2020 message would look like:

> We are the party of sanity. We are not making grandiose claims about this election determining the future of democracy. We are not ranting about how Republicans want to kill people, enslave minorities, or create ""The Handmaid's Tale."" We're calling a truce in the culture war. But also, we're going to restore order to a chaotic White House. Our leadership will be steady and stable and our tweets will not make the news.

> We are the party of compromise. We're going to make bipartisan deals when possible to achieve things that most Americans agree on. We are not going to abolish ICE. We will protect the border while making DACA law. We're not going to take away anyone's guns, but we will make some common-sense reforms to the background check system. We're not going to pick the furthest-left judges we can, but instead get Republican senators on board before making our choices.

> We're going to make practical improvements in your lives. We're not going to push for single-payer, but we will keep the best parts of Obamacare and offer a limited public option. If it works, we'll expand it. We're going to pass the infrastructure bill that Trump told you about but couldn't do and invest in the next 50 years. We will continue to push better trade deals that prioritize American workers, not consumers or corporations.

Something like that. It's not everything I would want by any means. But I think with the right messengers--someone like Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, Tim Ryan, or Mitch Landrieu--it can beat Trump in 2020."
DarraignTheSane,"Claire McCaskill just lost her senate race here in MO, and I will always be convinced it's because she continued to try to pander to the right - who was never going to vote for her anyway.

There is no ""winning the other side's votes"" anymore.  That's not how any of this works at this point.  A few decades ago, the GOP adopted their ""win at all costs"" strategy.  Newt Gingrich really brought it to the forefront, but they had been playing by that rule book for years before then.  The only problem is that Democrats have continued to try and play by the old rule book, where everyone tries to work together to find a middle ground for the common good.  They've been foolish enough to think that the GOP is still acting in good faith for all these years.

Centrists are extinct, whether they know it or not.  It's time the Democrats got with it and started playing by the same rules the GOP has been using against them, or the Dems will continue to lose."
WallStFinancier,"I think the biggest predictior going forward is going to be taking a look at the split between college educated and non college educated whites. 

Democrats will certainly have to contend with being a big tent party, but it’ll require another Obama type unifier to overcome the structural advantages Republicans enjoy. 

It was a good election for centrists and progressives alike despite some high profile losses. "
ender23,"If anything, how close those guys got say run to the left"
nickl220,"I don't know that I would draw that conclusion from the results, as Sherrod Brown is very liberal and he won again in Ohio (even as the more milquetoast gubernatorial candidate Cordray lost). I think the hype surrounding high profile candidates like Gillum and Beto blinded us to the actual electorate. Texas was very recently a 70/30 state. The fact that O'Rourke proved it is now capable of being 51/49 means the state is now in play in every election, and will likely eventually flip with the growth of Austin and other urban areas. Florida... is Florida. It's full of FloridaMans and in every election we can count on them to Florida it up real good. The good news though is that 1.4 million ex cons (many of which are non-violent drug offenders) can vote from here on out. This could dramatically change the state's electorate. 

As always, it doesn't matter what part of the spectrum Biden falls on; if he runs, he wins bigly, because everyone loves Biden. That being said, I'm not sure he gets the nomination (assuming he does run). "
bot4241,"People are underestimating Beto and Abrams. Beto did better then mutiple red state Democrats. He helped his party win Texas districts. Abram is still in recount range. She helping the Dems in ga-06.

Vandechoz,"How can they run any more to the center? The Democrat *politicians* are all very center already, it's the loud progressive and regressive activists that are driving the center away."
LiberalArtsAndCrafts,"If Democrats are smart they'll establish a national message that transcends a left/moderate divide and appeals to a huge swath of potential Democratic voters.   
Voting rights, including exploring [vote reform](http://www.equal.vote) designed to break the two party system. Anti-corruption in the form of campaign finance transparency. Marijuana descheduling/decriminalization.  
That plus healthcare and a continued pounding home of the risks associated with climate change and the need for bold action soon would be the strongest national message, one which turns off almost no one on the left or in the center, and can motivate party skeptical and disengaged voters. "
GhastliestPayload,"If anything, last night showed that running a progressive campaign inspires voters to get out. The issue was structural disadvantages for Democrats including gerrymandering, more blue Senate seats up for re-election, and voter disenfranchisement (ie ND and the native IDs).

I think looking at the results is very misleading. Democrats certainly took back a lot of control, but 2020 will certainly be the ultimate litmus test for this idea. If Republicans continue to push cutting SS and Medicare and gutting some of the patient protection clauses of the PPACA, I could see another opportunity for Democrats to take even more control away. "
Ryanmoses10,"That’d be the smart thing to do... so, no. "
NoonecanknowMiner,"I don’t think policy matters at this point. If the last three years have taught me anything, it’s this unfortunate truth. Americans aren’t very smart. They’re very easily manipulated and vote more on emotion than raw facts. I think Bernie could beat Trump, but then again, he lost to Clinton hand over fist. Clinton could not beat Trump, and I wouldn’t expect her to this time. 

What the Democrats need as a left wing Donald Trump. Not a corrupt asshole necessarily (but again, I don’t think that matters), but someone who will yell and shout things. They need someone who keeps things simple and isn’t afraid to hold back. One of Clinton’s biggest mistakes was apologizing for calling Trump voters deplorable. She should have doubled down, called them scum, racists, selfish, etc. It wouldn’t have won her the election, but I think she may have been able to get some more votes. The Democrats need someone who will demonize Trump voters in a way no one has before. I’m not saying this is good, mind you. But this is how they will win. Howard Dean could be someone, but he might not be interested.

It also, even worse, may have to be someone without political experience. One reason Trump won is because people hate career politicians, and he wasn’t one. People joke about Oprah Winfrey, but she might be the Democrat’s best chance. As far as career politicians go, the only one that really comes to mind is Beto O’Rourke, but considering how demonized he was by the right, who knows. Again, I’m not supporting this. Frankly, I think that possibility makes us look like a joke. If the ballot is Oprah vs. Trump, I’m voting Oprah and then booking it to Europe. "
cgreeratl,"If you look closely, all of these races initially were expected to result in crushing defeats for the progressive or more left leaning democrats. Republican lite is the losing strategy. Trump took many of these seats by double digit wins. Many of these progressive candidates brought in record numbers of voters and closed deficits to make them nail biting races. "
MegaSansIX,"In 2008, Republicans blamed McCain's loss on his moderate views. In 2012, Republicans blamed Romney's loss on his moderate views. They ran Trump and now they have more energy than ever. Moderate politicians don't inspire voters to go to the polls. Also, realize Texas and Georgia aren't swing states. Those races should've gone to Republicans with double digit leads. "
imrightandyoutknowit,"After last night, I'm convinced ideology matters less than personal branding and partisanship. For example, Democrat will continue to struggle in Florida if they cannot cut into GOP gains with non educated white voters or cut into GOP support among Latinos. Gillum, a black progressive, barely ran behind white moderate Bill Nelson. That's because Trump is decently popular in Florida as a whole. The inconvenient truth Democrats and Republicans have to accept about Florida is that Trump's divisiveness suits him there. In hindsight, the better candidate for Florida Democrats may well have been Phil Devine, a less dickish Alan Grayson. I'm convinced larger states need bigger colorful characters to drive politics. Each of those races have caveats though. Maybe Gillum wins with no corruption allegations. Maybe Nelson does better not running against the sitting governor that responded to major hurricanes 

Several moderate Democrats also lost in nationalized races in Trump leaning states, particularly, McCaskill, Donnelly, and Heitkamp. Tester and Manchin had incredibly close races. Meanwhile, Stacey Abrams did better than many past white moderate candidates in Georgia and Beto O'Rourke was able to inspire presidential level turnout. Even though he narrowly lost, his coattails carried some suburban, Texas Triangle Dems to victory. If he was able to eke out a narrow victory, his coattails may have been able to flip about half a dozen more seats to Democrats.

Basically, future 2020 candidates should just throw everything they know out the window. For one, I think these midterms make the case that the next nominee should *not* be a Senator, former Obama admin member, or former candidate. Democrats did best when they were able to run to localized districts, particularly the suburbs outside metro areas. Democrats were also able to make some gains in governorships and state legislatures. What better foil to Trump in 2020 than a governor with no Washington stench? The Beto 2020 hype is also real and its a legitimate question to wonder what he could have done against Trump if he made a Texas statewide race a Tossup affair. Of course, that also opens the door for the Avenattis and Garcettis and Buttigiegs and deBlasios of the party, basically people that have never won a statewide race. "
InternationalDilema,"Short version is you always have the two options of playing to your base and running on turnout or casting a wide net and getting more of the electorate.

The GOP base turns out more reliably so they tend to be more successful with the thump the hell out of their core style.

BUUUUT now that Trump is there, his existence is pretty much all the Dems need to hit their base and whatever happens making things a referendum on Trump will turn out their base. So by trying to please them more, they will get very little marginal return. The best way to get margins is by going for those in the middle, it's pretty much all that's left.

All of that said, really the biggest issue is just how charismatic and likable each candidate is and people don't give two fucks about policy and only care about teams."

FadingHideoutGardene,"Stop worrying about left v right.  The core issues are not extreme issues.

The voters want integrity.  They want jobs that come with decent benefits, and maybe even a future.  They want health care.  They want to end gun violence without buying back all those guns.

And nobody from either extreme wants to see people sitting around unemployed just because they aren't old white guys.  The Ds need to remind everybody that we have lots of people who have the training and skills to power our economy without looking like somebody who signed the Declaration of Independence.  And we all want school that continue to make sure everyone can pull their own weight.

There are right v left issues where opposing the extreme right makes sense, too:  People want tax cuts, but most of them will be better off if we raise the zero bracket and stop giving away the store to the top."
000ello_7,"Unpopular opinion and I personally do not like it but I think Democrats absolutely have to move to the middle in 2020. At this point in the game, someone that is a Democrat is *most likely* not going to vote for a Republican AND vice versa. Meaning, people are not going to be crossing the aisle anytime soon. Our worlds are too polarized for that right now. So Dems should understand that they are not going to be able to touch Trump's base. However, they will be able to pick up people that have voted for Dems in the past but, voted for Trump in 2016. The ""Trump Triers"". In order to get those Trump triers to come to the Dems side, the Dems have to meet them in the middle. It will not work if the go more left. Dems do not have enough electoral votes to be able to go more left and still win in 2020.

&#x200B;

Also, if you look at the US house districts around the nation, the districts that voted for Obama and then Trump are the districts that were more likely to vote for a Democrat than districts that voted for Romney and Trump. "
drarch,"Democrats in districts where it's acceptable need to continue and stretch the [Overton Window](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window). 

Universal Healthcare is an example where Democrats can and should champion progressive family values. 

Of course not all Democrats can afford to go too far to the left, Manchin being the most obvious example. 

As long as they're there for the big votes, though, I think compromise on smaller issues in pursuit of bipartisan consensus should be encouraged. "

Jareth86,"John Stewart once famously said that ""the house of representatives is full of insane jackasses"". And that it was one of the few places in which extremist rhetoric would work in your favor.

I think part of the Democratic Party's problem is that they have lost sight of which issues are considered extreme by the general public. I've been a life long Democratic voter as has everyone I know, but I don't have a single aquantaince who believes in a ""patriarchy"", thinks that preschoolers can be transgendered, thinks radical Islam is feminist, or who doesn't like capitalism.

These beliefs may be preaching to the choir for local congressional districts and will win some seats, but they are toxic to the majority of normal liberals and do nothing but stifle voter turnout on the left. 

Case in point, they just LOST four seats to the most unpopular president in recent history. "
CarCrashRhetoric,"Fuck no. People showed up for those candidates in historically red districts and despite voter suppression. Yesterday showed that people want change. They need to stop trying to court Republicans.

Bashfluff,"Politicians should represent their constituents on the local level, but we've seen that support for progressivism candidates is growing rapidly on the national stage, so that's the direction we should be approaching on there. Any presidential candidate for the Democrats would do well to try to go all-out with the sort of progressivism that can connect them with the working class and couple with more moderate stances on the more extreme social issues that aren't so popular. I'm not talking about LGBT support, here, as much as immigration and the sort of attitude which ruffled moderates when it came to Kavanaugh.

That sort of candidate comes the closest, to me, to uniting Democrats while giving Republicans an appealing option."
djphan,"It's complicated and anyone trying to draw clear narratives from these midterms is just forcing it... lot's of different things happened across the nation.... 

Beto ran ahead of the republican lean and Gillum and Abrams probably slightly behind.... Donnelly, McCaskill and Heidi lost... but Manchin and (probably/maybe) Tester wins... Rosen won and Sinema (probably/maybe) loses...  

That's a real mixed bag of results but for 2020 none of them really matter aside from NV(and you can throw FL in there also)....    

The key for 2020 and beyond for Democrats still remains the rust belt until the sunbelt can get there... i think it's clear at this point that Democrats are close (GA, AZ, FL.. NC also close.. TX further) but it will take probably 2022/2024 before they can get over the hump...  Obama/Trump districts in the rust belt largely flipped back into the blue column and that's a very good sign for Democrats.. and I would rate MN, WI, MI and PA as the only battlegrounds worth talking about for 2020....   

If I had to firmly answer I would say a generic progressive politician probably does worse overall given how they generally underperformed other kinds of candidates this year and in 2016...and given the types of candidates that won in the rust belt... 

Baldwin, Stabenow, klobuchar, smith, evers, wolf and whitmer are generally not seen as super progressive as a group so anyone further to the left than these candidates and is fairly generic(ie. russ feingold) probably won't do well.... However.. if you're not generic and you do some serious outreach and get SOME credibility in rural areas you can probably overperform (Beto/Brown/Tester/Manchin)... it will probably help to be a white male also...   

I think there are other factors that are going to be way more important than how far a candidate leans in any case....  "

A candidate that believes to the core what they are campaigning about can convey sincerity and passion. That’s what will win, If that’s closer to the center, fine, more left of center, great. Obviously there is risk in being left of center in many states, especially Florida and Ohio. Trump will be sullied and damaged in 2020.

Or that Nelson was extremely close to the same result as Gillum.

People seem to like to take every single result as proof that everyone should adopt their policy preference.  But I don't think policy preferences are the main takeaway.  The bigger take away is the ever more extreme tribalism with democrats increasing strength in their states and republicans increasing strength in theirs.   The 2020 implication should be that the electoral college is everything because there are very few states left in play right now.  Democrats would be best picking the best rust belt candidate.  That means both Bernie and Biden might be better than someone in the middle, left, or right of the two ideologically."

Yes, Beto and Stacy lost, but they're both running in fairly solid red states, and their margin of defeat was surprisingly narrow. More importantly, the turnout was enormous, especially in Texas. 

The Democrats need a dramatic message. They need to embrace their version of the Tea Party, otherwise they'll lose to the Republicans just for being boring.

FoolAllergy,"The first thing that needs to be pointed out is that Progressive Democrats ARE centrist Democrats.  In stark contrast, Third Way/Blue Dog Democrats are firmly right of center/Conservative based on their economic and fiscal policy positions.  Blue Dog Democrats must not be allowed to hijack the Democratic Party and House again, given their poor economic and fiscal track records.

The second thing that needs to be pointed out is that most of the Third Way Democratic Senators lost their elections, effectively derstroying arguments that they are ""electable"" or a ""necessary presence"" in the Democratic Party.  What is particularly reprehensible about the Third Way crowd post-election is that they are attempting to extort rule changes from presumptive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a crass and self-serving effort to prevent economic and fiscal legislative reforms that SHOULD be implemented.  It's an abject disgrace after Republicans and Third Way Democrats used present House rules to force radical right wing economic and fiscal initiatives on the nation, like the Trump tax cuts. 

To answer the question directly...Yes, the Democratic Party should tack toward policy positions held by centrist Progressive Democrats.  This observation isn't based on the Republicans ability to steal elections by hook and by crook or a ""socialist bias"".  Instead, it is firmly based on the far more effective economic and fiscal policy positions heldf by Progressive Democrats, like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  It has been conclusively proven time and again that the Progressive economic/fiscal policies once advocated by FDR work for this country and most Americans while the neoliberal economic/fiscal policy positions advocated by Hoover/Reagan/Republicans/Libertarians/Third Way Democrats have been failing the nation since the late-1960's and in the lead-up to the Great Depression.  Arguments from neoliberal circles that the status quo is serving this nation and most Americans are nothing but pathological lies based on what comprehensive economic and fiscal evidence and trends actually reveal.

>Does this show that running further left is a losing strategy for the Democrats?

NO! Keep in mind that Republican and Third Way Democratic candidates all invoked Progressive talking points to get elected, not Conservative neoliberalism or their legislative track records.  This alone proves that Progressive policy positions and politicians arethe direction to take.  No one could get elected without convincing U.S voters that they hold Progressive policy positions.  There's the irrefutable proof of where the political class and this nation need to head.  The American people are thirsting for Progressive economic and fiscal reforms, not more of the same neoliberalism that has dimninished them and their communities for decades.

>Would a candidate like Joe Biden give them a better chance to win than a candidate like Bernie Sanders?

If Joe Biden genuinely adopted Bernie's policy positions and surrounded himself with Progressive appointees and staffers capable of implementing FDR-style Progressive economic reforms, he would be unbeatable.  I'd like to think Joe is capable of that common sense leadership, but I'm highly doubtful that he would follow through as he should.  Bear in mind that President Obama's economic and fiscal capitulations obliterated the entire Third Way crowd's credibility.  This may not be a popular political observation in Democratic circles, but it happens to be an ugly truth.

>What would be the best strategy for the Democrats moving forward?

Simple...give Trump and Senate Republicans more Hell that the 2010 Republican-led House gave President Obama and a Democratic-led Senate.  Democrats have ample legal ammunition to use against both Trump and the GOP.  Since the House has the nation's purse strings, Democrats should use that blunt weapon to starve Republican legislative initiatives to death.  While they are at it, House Democrats should pass a series of reform-minded economic and fiscal initiatives to prove to the American people that they are the superior legislators in Congress."

ViskerRatio,"It's not really about *policy* so much as purposefully driving people away.

The core problem is that the fringe left is running amuck and mainstream Democrats aren't willing/able to reign them in. #MeToo, BlackLivesMatter, antifa - even SNL and other late night comics - make for horrible optics. Even relatively professional organizations like the New York Times and Washington Post have gone completely off the deep end with 'the bad people are taking over' rhetoric.

Alienating half the country and leaving half your own party with a bad taste in their mouth from the vitriol is not a winning strategy. Now, you can certainly try a no-true-Scotsman argument that it's some sort of radical fringe - but that's just arguing that the saner heads running the Democratic Party are feckless and incompetent, not that the party itself is blameless."

Florida might be the most centrist state in the country.  

I never understood the Dems strategy where the country went way right in 2016 but they think the solution is to go way left now.  It makes no sense to me.  Dems did well in place they didn't expect to by putting forward moderates.

If use democrats choose obstruction and investigation over legislation, and the economic policies that have help the economy explode are slowed or halted, they can kiss 2020 goodbye.

If instead, they choose to legislate and work with the senate and the president to get things done and continue the progress of the last few years, they stand a good chance of taking more seats in 2020. "
Unshkblefaith,"It doesn't matter how centrist Democrats are, they will always be cast by their opponents as ""coastal elites"" and ""socialists"". Furthermore, what is the point of a Democrat winning an election if they are a ""centrist"" who consistently votes to slash individual rights and protections in the name of bipartisanship. No, Democrats need to stick to their guns and and show how their policies will improve the lives of everyone, and not just the top 0.1%."

We believe in science, education, and encouraging women to participate in running our country. Our mothers and daughters are not property of men.

We are not the party of the KKK and Nazis. Not all Republicans are racist but every racist I’ve met is a Republican.

talkin_baseball,"The Florida gubernatorial and Texas Senate races were pipe dreams. If Abram loses, it will be due to election-rigging by Kemp. Don't know enough about Ojeda to opine. 

Democrats won because their base was energized for this election and due to first-time voters. Democrats owe it to these constituencies to go all-in on progressive priorities for the next two years. That means, at the congressional level: 

* Protecting Special Counsel Mueller and investigating the Trump family's corruption. 
* Investigating Kavanaugh's apparent perjury and alleged sexual assault in his various congressional testimonies over the years. 
* Stonewalling congressional Republicans' efforts to roll back vital regulations and to cut taxes on the wealthy. 
* Paralyzing the Trump White House with congressional investigations into all the rampant corruption in the White House. To that end, congressional Democrats need to make clear to anyone working for this administration, or thinking about doing so, that they will need to hire a personal lawyer, that they will spend most of their waking hours responding to congressional subpoenas for document production and sworn testimony and that there is a good chance they will end up with civil and criminal charges filed against them and even filing for bankruptcy. 
* Exercising the power of the purse to defund or thwart the executive branch's enforcement priorities. 

It's curious how Republicans never get the lecture about moving to the middle, even though they have all the structural advantages going into federal elections and thus, tend to lack the legitimacy conferred by being popular-vote winners. "

Nefandi,"All you have to do is look at the polls for the presently popular so-called ""far left"" policies, which are really centrist policies.  Of course the Dems should run as far left as is possible.  There is nothing to gain by running to the right except another Trump and similar.

The way capitalism is going right now is 100% unsustainable on so many levels, environment, economical, ethical, power balance, etc.

If we refuse to move to the left, we will have to welcome fascism instead.  That's not a joke or an exaggeration.

If we still believe in a decent society and democracy, leftward movement is absolutely imperative.

Beto O'Rourke first entered the national stage by primarying the incumbent Democrat in TX16 from the right and then joined the New Democrat coalition once he was elected. "
Wierd_Carissa,"Not only that, but I think it's definitely reasonable to suggest that enthusiasm for O'Rourke is what helped to turn some House districts in Texas blue that otherwise certainly would have been red. His race was anything but a failure, realistically speaking. "

Why do you say that?  I don't think a more centrist version would have pushed left-leaning voters to Cruz.  I *do* think a centrist version could have taken more votes from Teddy.

The only reason I could see a hard Left Beto doing better than a centrist one is in motivating voters.  But it's not clear to me that would be more votes than a moderate candidate in Texas."

CilantroLover22,The big factor will be whether there is a credible third party candidate.  If you have Kasich running as an independent then there wont be room near the center and the 2020 nominee will be the most progressive we have seen thus far...My money is on Beto.
didhugh,"The moderate Bill Nelson outperformed Gillum by about 40,000 votes and also lost.  Yes, there are lots of other variables in both races to consider, but from that it’s clear Florida is not proof of how Democrats need to move to the center.  If anything, it’s an example of how it doesn’t matter very much whether or not you move to the center."
the1egend1ives,"Beto put up a good fight not because of his ideas or politics, but because he was authentic, had a lot more funding than Cruz (from out-of-state, no less), had a rock-star personality (he appeared on Ellen), and because Cruz was a damaged candidate. Honestly, the fact that Beto STILL lost despite all of these advantages is a testament to how solidly red Texas is.

Look at the Democrats who did pick up seats in the house, and you'll see that a lot of them are moderates or have military backgrounds. If the Dems want to have a chance in 2020, then they have to run a more center candidate. Left-leaning individuals will still vote blue straight down the ticket, and the Dems will snag the moderate voters as well."
AnghellicKarma,"> If you ran a more centrist version of Abrams/Beto, I don't believe they'd have done as well last night.

I'd like to offer the opposite take.  
  
Beto ran to the left of *Pelosi* on several issues. That played well outside of Texas and gained him a national spotlight. It didn't play well enough in Texas for him to win.  
  
With the disparity between how many Republican votes the governor of Texas received vs what Cruz received, there was a lot of voters that voted Republican that were dissatisfied with Cruz (but not Abbott). And yet it appears enough turned their noses for Cruz to keep him in office.  
Had Beto appealed to them by being just the tiny bit more centrist, I think he would've easily won in Texas.  
  
It's a long read, but [this article from Politico](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/11/04/ted-cruz-beto-orourke-texas-senate-2018-election-222188) goes into the notion of Beto blowing it by not appealing to enough people in Texas."

Cryptic0677,"Beto would have done better here if he had been more moderate on guns, hands down. People were ready to vote against Trump, but that really hurt him."
jesseaknight,"I think if Gwen Graham had made it through the primary (she lost to Gillium by 45k votes), she'd have beat DeSantis. She was a more moderate Democrat and would've picked up the ""we don't like Trump but we also don't like: gun laws, high taxes, etc"" vote. That block is not progressive, but many of them would vote for a moderate Democrat (only 55k would have been needed, unless you figure they voted republican and would flip - meaning only 28k would need to flip).

IND_CFC,"> The Senate was a bloodbath for the Center, most of them didn't even come close.

This doesn't really make sense. What races are you talking about?

Indiana? The only reason it was Democratic for the last 6 years is because the GOP nominee last time talked about rape being part of God's plan. Donnelly holding onto that seat against a normal GOP candidate would have been a miracle.

Florida? Nelson barely lost in an election where the progressive Democrat gubernatorial candidate also lost. Both the progressive wing and the centrist wing lost close races there. 

North Dakota? Again, much like Indiana, it was a miracle for the Democrats to ever hold that seat in the first place. This is a very red and pro-Trump state. 

So where is this ""bloodbath for the center""? There isn't a single Senate race where a Democrat had a realistic chance of winning and lost. "
memberCP,"I would disagree it was a bloodbath for the center because of their centrism, 

it was bloodbath for red state democrats that voted against Kavanaugh. Every single one of them lost, only Manchin squeaked through. "
flightpay,"Ted Cruz was also deeply unpopular. So there are definitely a lot of factors here.



>In florida, Bill Nelson, a middling democrat lost alongside gillium.

And yet Gillum lost by a larger margin than Richardson.

Yes, the centrist lost in a lot of states that they otherwise had no chance in in pretty much any other year. However, there was clearly no hidden groundswell of ultra liberal or progressive voters. That whole idea that the Democrats need to go farther left to get these voters is complete bullshit

"
Marylandman101,Not to mention odjeda lost in a plus 40 trump district. He barley lost. Is op saying that a hilary clinton type candidate would of won?
ertebolle,"Yeah, a lot of left-wing positions are actually pretty popular - especially in the suddenly-Democrat-friendly-again midwest - so they don't really need to run away from them.

The path to a Democratic senate majority in 2020 or 2022 lies in taking back Obama states (Colorado, Maine, North Carolina, Iowa, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania) and capitalizing on shifting demographics in the South / Southwest (Florida, Arizona, maybe outside shots at Texas and Georgia). None of those are places where you need to pander to small-government religious nutters to get a majority of votes."
dmtry,"Careful you don’t read too much about the Brown win. Ohio Republicans are going to be beating themselves up over that race for a long time. Yes he won by a good margin, but from what I heard they were expecting to lose by twice as much. Hell, they weren’t sure they’d win any of the statewides, and they end up winning all of them. But if they spent any money on that race, or had a better candidate, Brown would have had a much more significant challenge looking at how the rest of the ticket went. "
Station28,"I agree. The seats that dems should have taken, but didn’t, were lost by moderates. Ones they took that were upsets were taken by progressives. Gillium tacked center after the primaries and look what happened "
hjonbe,"So your assessment is that the way for progressives to win is to run more progressive candidates in swing states/districts. 

And as evidence you point out that Gillum lost in Florida...

Gillum was a progressive. Nelson was a ""moderate"", and they both lost. 

If your thesis was correct Gillum would have outperformed Nelson by a significant margin. That didn't happen. 

Maybe I'm misinterpreting what you said. "

Agreed. Feinstein held on in California without too much trouble. And oddly enough, it seemed like the more conservative areas in California were choosing de León over Feinstein (I'm guessing just to stick it to Feinstein despite her being less progressive?).

> With the exception of Tester, every single Dem in a battleground state that voted no has lost. Now, I'm not so sure it was worth the losses in the senate.

And 70.2 million dollars against Cruz's 33.4 million spent to defend. This is 'Lying Ted' Cruz we are talking about, reviled by Republicans and Democrats alike, he's not far from Trump in terms of unpopularity. Beto never had a chance, he just had so much money that it looked like he did. 

'Outfundraise the opponent by quadruple' is not exactly what I would call 'strategy', how he framed his discourse is irrelevant if Dems can't consistently shore up that kind of cash every battle. "
TexVikbs,"I think Beto's biggest selling point was that he wasn't Cruz. From a lot of people who I talked two, their main reason for voting for Beto was just to unseat Cruz, policy was on the back burner. I am generally a moderate and had a hard time voting for Beto simply because of some of this stances, especially like you've mentioned in gun control. Had he moved more moderate on a few topics i think he would have done better, but he did manage to turn Tarrant County blue (as of time of this comment) which has long been a conservative urban area. 

Also, do people actually send you data?"

hjonbe,"> Haven't followed the FL-GOV race closely but I heard Gillum started going moderate in the last weeks before the election - argument goes that he could've instead fired up the base to increase turnout. 

Sorry, but I think the idea he went centrist is dubious at best. But the idea that he needed to ""fire up the base"" seems silly. How is the base NOT fired up when they are going against Trumpy Desantis who doeesn't even believe in climate change (In FLORIDA), and Gillum, who was getting such incredibly positive coverage as the ""next Obama""?

The ""base"" was fired up. On both sides. More Republicans showed up. "
Baby_Beluga,"The enthusiasm definitely brought in some new voters and lots of outside efforts, media attention and cash to those races. However, at the end of the day, you still need Georgia, Texas and Florida voters to vote for you.

Moderates are always at a disadvantage in the party because they are expected to **win**. Progressives don't have to win. They just have to ""exceed expectations"" which frankly can mean whatever you want. That's why this morning Beto, Gillum and Abrams are being treated like superstars for ""over performing,"" and if they'd lost by 5 additional points, the narrative would be the same; you can't lose the game of low expectations. Meanwhile, the losses of the red state moderates is being used as further proof that the centrist wing of the party should be purged. The establishment types who won, and who comprise almost all of the winning candidates, are being largely ignored.

Fixed that for you. Not just the platform, but please stop trying to shove made-for-TV candidates into areas where they won't fit. Traditional news outlets as well as social media constantly - and I mean constantly - trumpeted Beto and Gillum as rockstars and the next Obama. If you live in a conservative area, you'll know well that this is *exactly* the wrong thing to do and actually poisons their candidacies badly. Rural people already resent coastal urban influence enough, they don't want their representatives to be hand-picked by some CNN talking heads sitting in a New York skyscraper deciding who to promote on the national airwaves.

The Democrats who won last night did so without media glamorization, because they focused local. Pretty much all the Democrats who went national, crashed and burned.

Nevoadomal,"> Universal Healthcare is an example where Democrats can and should champion progressive family values.

I think this is emblematic of the biggest problem on the left at the moment - they don't really understand those who aren't on their side, and so miss what should be clear opportunities for reaching out beyond their core.

Because Universal Health Care should indeed be a winning issue for Democrats. But not by campaigning on it in the name of progressive values, or because America needs to help the sick, or because people have a moral duty of care, etc. Anyone who sees the world through that lens *already* supports Universal Health Care.

No, to sell the American public on Universal Health Care, Democrats need to champion it as a policy meant to advance *conservative* values. Emphasize that universal care would be a cost savings. The U.S. Government spends more per capita on healthcare than Canada does, then U.S. citizens pay as much again out of pocket. So universal healthcare would be slightly cheaper for the government, much cheaper for individual citizens, and benefit many more people. Support it on the grounds of efficiency.

Likewise, instead of selling it as a moral social necessity, promote it as a practical form of insurance, a good self-interested investment. Everyone gets seriously ill if they live long enough.

Heck, take a page from the Republican playbook on selling the public on corporate tax cuts. Point out that universal healthcare is a competitive advantage, making it easier for America to lure the best and brightest from other countries. You can even make it an overtly nationalist appeal, for God's sake. "

Nevoadomal,"> I never understood the Dems strategy where the country went way right in 2016 but they think the solution is to go way left now.

It is the inevitable result of a two-party system with a polarized electorate. If most people are in the center, then centrist candidates can easily win, and the majority of people will be happy with the result. So, if you have an electorate that is 20% super conservative, 20% super progressive and 60% centrist, then both parties will run centrist candidates, and whoever wins in the general, 80% of the population will be happy-ish, the centrists because the government is mostly centrist, and one of the extreme factions because at least the gov't tilts their way instead of the other.

But if you polarize the electorate so it is, say, 40% super conservative, 40% super progressive, and 20% centrist, then increasingly only extreme candidates will make it through the primary process. And whoever wins, 60% of the population will be dissatisfied, with most of those being furious about the outcome.

The big problem is that when polarization occurs, it tends to be self-sustaining, with the anger and dissatisfaction driving people ever further apart. "

Jobrien1998,"I think the Dem problem in 2016 was that they ran such a centrist candidate, not to mention the fact that Clinton was so disliked generally.  The polls showed that Bernie would’ve crushed Trump.  Given, the polls haven’t exactly been accurate lately, but still, they were much better than Clinton’s.  The solution from here on out is absolutely for the Dems to run a progressive candidate in 2020, and for them to run candidates that actually represent their constituents in Congress.  At the same time, I think they should try to shy away from too much triangulation.  "

This means that you can reliably take a certain block of a demographic and project if it will vote for the Democrat or the Republican regardless of the candidate or state.

Do Democrats need to pull more to the center? Or do they just need to pay more attention to the districts in which they’re favored?

For example, I don’t think being pro-choice is that progressive with respect to the Democratic party itself. Most mainstream Democrats would support it as well.

totallyNotShillin,"> It’s time to stop worry about the right and unite the left. Period.

Problem there is that past a certain point the left is all about division.

It may be purpling (remains to be seen if that is true), but it isn't there yet.

Florida seems to be an exception to this rule. They have stayed relatively right leaning, despite being  a big state with a heavily diverse population. 

The country is getting MORE conservative in the rural states. ND, WV, MT, etc.

So that's good news for the house in a lot of ways if you're a Dem/progressive. And potentially disastrous news for the Presidency (electoral college) and the senate. We got some mixed news in the midwest. PA, WI look great, OH not so much. 

As long as rural states continue to trend towards the GOP the Dems will struggle mightily to take the senate. "
Squalleke123,"> especially in the suddenly-Democrat-friendly-again midwest - so they don't really need to run away from them.

It's expected no? Trump ran on protectionism, so did Bernie. It was always obvious that Clinton's globalist approach wouldn't score there.

As someone once said: it's the economy, stupid."
RIPGeorgeHarrison,"Thats fair, but that statement also applies to a lot of Democratic senate candidates, including a lot that won.  McCaskill, Heitkamp, and Donelly did way worse than they were expected to and lost, while Manchin and Stebanow despite winning had pretty underwhelming performances.  I'm not sure if Tester also underperformed.  
"
InternationalDilema,"Yeah, Brown was one of the biggest polling misses of the night and it was in GOP's favor. Winning by a small margin when forecasted to win by double digits isn't that encouraging."
Banelingz,"It’s a bit absurd to say that Gillium ‘tacked center’ and claim that’s the reason he lost. There’s no indication that he in anyway went center, or that there was any outcry about it. I challenge you to provide some articles stating it. 

Fact is, the guy is a progressive, and Florida isn’t a progressive state. Three of the highest profile progressive governor races were all lost. If the takeaway is, ‘they weren’t progressive enough’ and to keep jamming progressive candidates in red states, then I fear for the future of the Democratic Party. "
Buck_Sackhammer,">Gillium tacked center after the primaries and look what happened

Gillum went hard on gun control after the primaries, I wouldn't call that tacking center. Probably a big reason why he lost, knowing this state. Every Republican here (half the state) loves their guns. Lots of Democrats are also pro-gun, and of the ones that aren't, the issue isn't high up on their priority list. I don't care if gun control is the right policy, it's killing Democrats' chances to gain control and implement any other liberal/progressive/sane policy. "

usered77,"> The seats that dems should have taken, but didn’t, were lost by moderates. Ones they took that were upsets were taken by progressives.

This is just blatantly false on every level. Let's overview here:

Berniecrats like James Thompson, Kara Eastman, Jess King, and Randy Bryce all lost. Gillum moving to the center generated little noise. Instead, he was constantly attacked by the right wing machine for being a socialist. He lost mostly because of racism but his progressive stances may have partially made DeSantis' margin. Beto showed a strong performance in a red state but he lost to a hated Republican incumbent. Beto's popularity was one of a kind, and I don't think it will translate to other Berniecrat candidates. (Though Beto's record is pretty ""neoliberal"", he campaigned as a progressive. And neither his base nor his haters don't seem to know about his true record at all, with the former fawning over his progressive stances and the latter constantly attacking him for being a socialist.)

The ones that were elected were in safe D places, where any Dem nominee who breathes always wins.

Most of the moderate Democratic house candidates who defeated their insurgents fared well. The DCCC's preferred ""establishment"" candidates were more successful in their efforts to flip the House seats than the progressives in competitive races. The conservative Senate Dems didn't have a good night but that was because of the Kavanaugh vote, not because of they were too centrist.

538 summed up the night:

>So far, establishment primary candidates who fended off liberal insurgents in House races are looking good (Pennsylvania 7th, Kansas 3rd and Texas 7th), while winning liberal insurgents are fairing poorly (Nebraska 2nd and Pennsylvania 1st). But especially combined with Gillum’s loss, it may come to be seen as a better evening for sticking with Democratic establishment picks.

The upset House races won by Democrats were done by Democratic moderates. See OK-05, SC-01, NY-11.

Edited for clarity."
Dolphman,"I didn't say anything of that note, just noting they both lost. I'm talking about the midwest senate campaign frameworks."
Dolphman,"I'm doubtful of that. While Polling showed dips after Kav, all of the Dems drastically under performed. So while they may have gotten more votes, likely no way to victory."
Dolphman,"I was on mobile, apologies."
Noobasdfjkl,"> Doesn't Manchin suggest a counterpoint to this?

No, I messed up. Manchin voted yes, the others voted no. Manchin is the biggest supporting point.

>Yes. Unless a single Republican senator was willing to cross the aisle to ""No,"" it likely was not worth it.

Which I hate. I want them to vote with their ethics, and I know I'm extra not-objective the day after Dems get slapped in the Senate, but it really doesn't seem worth the lost seats at this point. At least 2024 will be a nicer election for Democrats than this one was. "
PM-ME-GIS-DATA,"Alright, that is definitely going to depress Dem turnout especially among youth and latinos. I'm surprised I didn't hear much buzz about that. 

I think party labels in red states makes moderate Democrats much less effective. Manchin is the exception, but it seems a conservative in a red state is going to assume any candidate with a D next to their name is ""another evil democrat"" taking on the national party's platform."

PoliticallyFit,Exactly. I think this election was more of a referendum based on cultural aspects than anything else.
hjonbe,"I'll get crucified for saying this, because a lot of progressives don't want to admit it, but the Kavanugh vote, and obviously how the Dems in the committee handled the accusations (waiting until the last minute, bringing up the Avenatti BS allegations) conceivably cost a couple senate seats for the Dems. 

So at the end of the day the gamble did not pay off. It absolutely energized the GOP base (exit polls show this in red states), more so than it energized Dems, and plausibly cost them in the senate.

I think there is a large portion of the electorate that very much wants their side to win, and then I think there is a smaller bit that is really turned off by the bickering. I think this type of personality & rhetoric is very pleasing to that bit.

ManBearScientist,"Don't get me wrong, they should still fight like hell to win seats in the Senate.  But they could win the popular vote by 5 million for the next 3 elections and come away without a majority.  The structural advantage of the GOP cannot be understated and not getting a majority isn't worth losing sleep over. 

The fight in the Senate is more about preventing a super majority and trying to give the House some sway over judicial appointments.  And maybe a blue mega tsunami would even win seats or a majority in the Senate in a favorable year .  But long term the partisanship and lockstep nature of the GOP makes me feel like the Senate will remain like this for the foreseeable future. 

"
ManBearScientist,"Well, to be clear they are still the majority party.  They still have more votes, possibly even more than what they can eke out with more moderate candidates.  But they have no route to winning the Senate.  

I also think the problem for Democrats is the the GOP have no reason, or will, to turn down partisanship from their end.  If it hurts the Democrats in the Senate, it helps the GOP.  The Democrats can run moderates and make appeasements, but I'm not sure that will be enough to change the tide if the GOP plays up partisanship from their end.  "
comeherebob,">  The only viable strategy for Democrats is to tone down the partisanship.

As someone who is deeply skeptical of the hivemind’s certainty that Democrats can “excite” red states with “abolish ICE!” or whatever, I’m equally skeptical toward this conclusion too. 

Phil Bredesen and Dan McCready specifically ran on moderate platforms with appeals to bi-partisanship. Bredesen, in particular, got slaughtered (McCready came close, but he also still lost to a theocratic nightmare). 

I just don’t see any evidence that people care about a lack of “partisanship.” 
"
doormatt26,"They're definitely the majority party, but they'll remain the minority in the Senate so long as races there are nationalized. The GOP knows this, and Trump will continue to inflame culture issues in advance of 2020 to keep a grip on the Senate if nothing else. "
riggmislune,"Thems the breaks though. If Democrats aren’t able to do the things they’re promising and win, they should change the things they’re promising to do.

I feel as though running on guns in red states is a hinderance more than anything. It CAN excite a solidly blue base to come out to vote if they are otherwise apathetic, but it turns off a lot of moderates."
AnOfferYouCanRefuse,"If they performed about the same, doesn't that show people just weren't splitting tickets? I just threw the county level results into a spreadsheet, and they fall within 2 points of each other in nearly all but the smallest countries (where variance could be expected). Surely if people were splitting their tickets, we would see larger differences at the country level. 

In other words, Nelson should be over performing in rural parts of the state, compared to Gillum, but Gillum should be over performing in the urban centers, compared to Nelson. That's not the case, and given that that's not the case, all that can be said is policy, shit apparently even the candidate, didn't seem to matter much at all.

Sambean,"OK, but having that money to spend was a direct result of his lack of moderation.  He built a huge base of liberal support (and donations) from around the country because he was not running as the normal Texas democrat and people around the country supported it. 

And like you said, Cruz is unlikable and liberals are dying to get rid of him.  But its not like there are a shortage of Republicans that fit that bill as far as Democrats are concerned.

Beto built a national base of fundraising and got almost enough voters to go along with him.  He just wrote the playbook for other deep-red state Democrats to have a chance or at least force Republicans to play defense in safe states."

Clinton lost because she was unlikable and had so much baggage.  I highly doubt that Clinton lost because she was a centrist.  Obama was a centrist and he was very popular.

I also disagree that Bernie would have beaten Trump.  No self described socialist is going to be President any time soon.  He would have gotten crushed on his tax policy."
Nevoadomal,"It is true that Sanders was progressive and Clinton was centrist, but it is also true that Sanders was an outsider representing radical change while Clinton was a establishment type representing more of the same, and it seems likely that that was what mattered.

Otherwise, you have to believe that a bunch of uber-progressive types who firmly supported Sander's ideological outlook voted for Trump over a woman who was, for all her centrism, far closer to Sanders than Trump was.

That seems... unlikely. It seems more likely that voters desperately wanted change and simply didn't care what the change was. They'd have gone with Sanders if they could, because he was far more venerable than Trump, but Trump was just fine as a second choice if it meant not Clinton.

And I think a big problem for America right now is that everyone who has been lurking at the fringes of the Overton Window has convinced themselves that the general desire for change is in fact a desire for the kind of change they favor. Whereas probably what we are seeing is the dissatisfaction with political compromises coming to a head, which means you have a multitude of different groups with often conflicting ideas of what ""change"" should mean. "
MrSmallANDLoud,"Evidence: Gillum began shifting center during general, ended up losing ; Clinton: shifted general , lost rust belt ; obama - governed centrist, and democrats were decimated both at the state and federal level.

Whereas someone like beto, who spoke like a progressive, managed to make a giant polling defiicet in a state people laughed at winning. There was one other progressive last night you could point to, made up a literal 40 point deficit, for the life of me I can’t remember their name. Cortez another great example. Upset the political establishment by actually running as a progressive. 
Five thirty eight is inaccurate when it comes to matters outside polling data. They look at the data, make conclusions . Problem is, they never ask about the bias in their data. What bias? The fact that the entire democratic base gets suppressed when you run centrist right wing candidates. You begin to try to compete for the republican base, and of course the republican will won.

The consequences of that are the reason why. The social conservative agenda is at odds with the agenda's they need to run to win other states.

I dont understand the message that, Republicans are successful if they embrace Trumpian far right fearmongering, but Democrats have to be centrists as not to offend potential moderate voters. All that tells me is that Dems are too afraid to stick by party values - my values - and be spineless fence sitters giving me ""both sides"" bullshit. Didnt Heitkamp try to distance herself from the party by claiming she wasn't one of those ""crazy democrats like Pelosi""?

I'm on mobile and can't link right now, but fivethirtyeight.com had a number of compelling arguments that this was a more nationalized midterm than typical - and certainly Trump himself said it was a referendum on his performance.

Trump sucks up all the oxygen in the room, politically speaking. He's on the ballot even when he isn't. "

Of course, then she lost by over 20% and she never gained nearly the national press O'Rourke did, while O'Rourke ran a much stronger campaign and made it much more competitive than anyone would have suspected.

Obama ran on that change, and mostly failed to deliver, even though he did beat traditional statusquo politicians on the campaign trail. Trump ran on that change (his nationalist stance) as well.

Reality is, they are scared of progressive candidates. Beto pushed Texas much too purple for their liking and demographics are only getting worse there, not only with their hispanic population, but with big Tech companies flocking there in droves. Beto also had an effect nationally, and excitement was really off the charts for Democratic candidates. Trump and the GOP really got out the vote and Democratic candidates still crushed the house and earned 9 million more votes in the Senate. In a midterm year, for which Liberals rarely turn out.

How many times do we keep hearing that THIS TIME gun rights are going to carry the Dems to victory?

Parkland seemed like it could be a turning point, same thing with Sandy Hook and countless other events.

Menendez won handily. In the House, NJ-7 hadn't elected a Democrat since Carter was president.

comeherebob,"> That's why ""clinging to guns and religion"" or ""basket of deplorables"" are such a nightmare for Democrats trying to win outside of the urban coastal enclaves.

Lol, so what you’re saying here is that the actual problem is with the right-wing outrage-driven media apparatus and how even the so-called “liberal” media buys into it, and not any specific candidate? 

Because the Clinton example doesn’t make a lot of sense otherwise; Clinton’s speech was acknowledging the racist and bigoted elements of Trump’s base (which seems undeniable at this point), while still arguing that there at least an equal number of his supporters who aren't that way at all, who are good people wanting change and urging listeners to empathise with them. Obama, meanwhile, may have had the “guns and religion” gaffe, but still regularly denounced overzealous campus protests and shutting white males out of conversations.

I agree that Democrats need to expand outside of their progressive enclaves, but holding them accountable for dipshit 19yo Berkeley students just suggests to me that you’re grading on a curve – otherwise, you’d be holding Republicans equally responsible for the Steve Kings of the party (someone who, unlike Pelosi/Antifa or Duckworth/SNL, has actually been supported by the GOP instead of flatly denounced). 

This reaffirms my suspicion that many of these complaints are coming from deeply, socially conservative viewpoints that are transfixed by culture wars and changing demographics, and no amount of moderation or bipartisan appeals to shared interests are going to eclipse the primal, irrational power of white identity politics. 

As someone who is the daughter of a blue-collar swing voter, I think last night’s results reaffirm that we need to reestablish a coalition of minority/youth voters and purple state voters who are more concerned about their family’s wellbeing than Fox News culture wars. It might be difficult in our current environment, but that’s the only way – and meekly kowtowing to bullshit narratives like the ones you listed won’t help with the former part of that coalition.
"
UnstuckClimatologist,"OK, so the problem with that is social justice has been an absolute failure on every level, no matter how many minorities get seats in government.  Economic inequality is higher than ever for African Americans, and the vast majority of people have highly negative views of LGBT Americans.  There is zero protection against discrimination on a national level, and the current administration is currently planning to legislate trans people out of existence.  The reason why the Dems wont abandon these voters is for humanitarian reasons, not ""cultural Marxism"".  If Republicans weren't so extremely far to the right on these issues, these groups wouldn't vote Democrat, and Democrats wouldn't feel the need to protect them. "
Kakarot_faps,"They vote enough for it to matter in places where they live, and certainly voted a lot in Florida - turnout for them sucks but it’s enough in many cases.

The fact that this one was so close makes a stark urban/suburban and rural divide appear in Kansas.  KS-2 has been staunchly red for decades, with Douglas county staunchly staying liberal and Shawnee largely centrist.  Every other county north and south of these two to either state border is overwhelmingly conservative.  This election saw Shawnee lean far harder towards the democrats and i have a hunch that will be a trend along the I-70 route.  There's a definite unease with the trend of the GOP in cities in kansas, but there's not a whole lot of populated areas to really create a political shift."

Another corporate democrat with mountains of PAC money is not going to inspire people to vote.

bretth104,I don’t believe that. Trump made his pandering look real. And thats why his supporters love it. They truly think he’s always on their side.

TrurltheConstructor,"Hispanics are the least reliable  racial voting block in the country, unfortunately.  "
Foyles_War,"Healthcare is actually a very moderate issue unless you are referring to a ""socialized medicine is the only answer.""  However, my point was that moderates, esp middle class suburbanites tend to be the most reliable group of voters.  Ignoring them seems foolish particularly as they are likely to be willing to listen to a well reasoned argument (kind of goes with the whole ""I'm a moderate, not an indealogue"") and can be won over or turned off depending on tone and presentation."
Meowshi,People loved his personality and charm but his moderation lead to stunning Republican wins early into hits Presidency.  The base isn't going to accept moderation when the other party is losing its minds and being *rewarded* for it.
PimpyMcFinnigan,I had thought that’s what I’d said. It doesn’ matter if the left is made of moderates or liberals. Self-described Liberals voted for Trump cause they believed his bullshit
SDS1995,"As a Georgian that is demonstrably false. Stacy Evans was a weaker candidate. Jason Carter lost in 2014 and was relatively uninspiring. A candidate was needed who could fire up the base, maximize turnout in urban areas, make inroads in suburban areas, and reduce losses in rural areas. We now know that rural areas are a relative lost cause for Georgian Democrats (much like they are for Virginian Democrats), so those first 3 things become even more important. No other Georgian Democrat that was even a semi-serious candidate would have improved upon Abrams' vote totals. "

WallStFinancier,No no I can identify the trolls. I don’t doubt the sincerity of most Bernie supporters progressive values. It’s the cult of personality that drives me crazy. He’s just not politically popular outside of his niche group of white young suburbanites. His support of an AWB already means he lost the rural whites in any GE. He’s not a good candidate period. I’d rather see him spewing fire from his perch amd his reliable vote in the Senate. 
percussaresurgo,"Many of those ""Trump supporters"" were in St. Petersburg, Russia."

Jobrien1998,Sounds good to me.  
FoodandLiquor28,"Perhaps I'm too tired from staying up all night watching the election but I'm having trouble seeing a connection with your points and how they dispute what I said. He stayed in longer than expected, if he didn't it would have been more of a ""trounce?"" I'm not exactly sure what you are trying to say here. Remember my claim is that 43% isn't a ""trounce"" given the context around the race, how exactly does him staying in the race too long address this?

It seems to me like you are talking about that 12 point victory and as if it were in a vacuum, as if these were two equal candidate with equal advantages from the start. It's not like she was running against a known figure in national politics, she was running against someone that was largely considered a nobody. The primary was essentially treated as if it were a formality. It was significantly closer than expected, how close do you think pundits would have predicted a Clinton/Sanders race to be in early 2015? Would they even have said he would get 25%? I would say 43% is a monumental achievement when we look at the context around the race. Feel free to correct me but I don't think anybody would have imagined he would get half of that 43%.

Edit: Not exactly sure why I'm being down voted. Is polite discourse not appreciated here? If there is honest objections to my post, say it with words. "
Jobrien1998,"I agree with the first part, but not with the second.  Obvious choosing a radical won’t help, but there’s nothing radical about Bernie’s platform, or the progressives platform in general.  I fail to see how choosing a corporatist is going to help win back working-class voters.  Clinton certainly didn’t.  "

Captain-i0,"Of course you've seen that. That's the narrative that is being pushed by Hannity, Limbaugh and Fox News. 

Now, just ask yourself. Do you really think they are offering the Dems advice that they think will work, because they want them to be more competitive?"
Captain-i0,"> You reallt think centrisrsts who find the GOP reviling will suddenyl support far left policies that sound good but make no practical sense?

""centrists that find the GOP reviling"" is a broad target, but if you are referring to former Republicans, they are not really the demographic that Democratic Candidates need to court.

First, they would never be a reliable voting block for Democratic candidates. It will always be a game of appeasing them, under threat of them voting for their original party. It's a dumb strategy, one that they Democratic Party has tried many times, usually without success and, even when they have often results in candidates that don't do much to help the party anyway.

Second, former Republican ""centrists that find the GOP reviling"" are simply a lot less numerous than progressives, liberals, and those that are much further to the left. So, you will always turn off more voters than you would gain by this method. 

You are counting on the left holding their nose and voting for the Democratic Candidate, because the GOP is so reviling. Well, the left does not do that. It's been proven time and time again. Also, the same could be said about these mythical centrists. If they really find the GOP so reviling, why not expect them to hold their nose and vote for the progressive candidate? The only real answer as to why they wouldn't is if they don't *really* find the GOP that reviling.

**Bottom line:** The left has more numbers than the right. But they will not play the hold their nose and vote game. If they vote in the numbers they are capable of, they win. Period. Appeasing a group that doesn't believe in your goals is not a way forward. These centrist vote-flippers may be the enemy of your enemy, but they are not your friend. There's no reason to expect them to reliably vote for you long term.
"
Kidneyjoe,"The specific proposals by democrats are completely and utterly without merit. We've done an ""assault weapons"" ban before and it didn't work. No fly no buy was so blatantly unconstitutional that every single person who supported it should have been jettisoned in to the sun. Banning semi automatic rifles would necessitate the confiscation of hundreds of millions of firearms and spark a civil war that would kill more people than a thousand years worth of mass shootings. And then most of their talking points about ""loopholes"" and background checks are outright lies.

There are things they could suggest to increase gun control/reduce gun violence that would be logically defensible. Unfortunately they haven't quite figured that out yet."
TheCarnalStatist,"From an electoral standpoint? No. 

The court is stacked majorly against it ATM. Any legislation passed at this point wouldn't have teeth anyway. "
utspg1980,"Yes, those are all contributing factors to why Beto raised $70mil.

It cannot be summed up simply as ""because he's so charismatic""."
utspg1980,"Because Cruz put a big bullseye on his back when he ran for President and when he helped lead the movement to shut down the govt in 2013.

I used to live in Chicago and know half a dozen people there who donated to Beto without hearing him say a single word. All they knew was he was running against Cruz and he had a decent chance."
utspg1980,"There is either a false equivalency in your logic, or you're not stating your point clearly.

""He wouldn't have gotten 70 million if he wasn't charismatic"" is not the same thing as (and does not mean) ""he got 70 million because of his charisma""."

And if so, moderate to who?  Would we be going by whichever way the fickle 5% of this country that still swings decides to do at the last minute come next election?, cuz I don't consider those guys to be political sages."

Nevoadomal,"Except it was Obama who said rural voters ""cling to God and guns"" and Clinton who tarred them as ""deplorable"". The contempt Democrats feel for ""flyover country"" is evident everywhere you look, and nothing is so toxic to a relationship as contempt. The GOP can only get away with refusing to compromise because conservative voters don't pressure them to compromise, and conservative voters aren't pushing for compromise because why would they ever want to compromise with people who've made it clear they think they are scum?"
ViskerRatio,"I don't disagree. The majority of Democrats are fairly reasonable people.

But the fringe are very vocal - and that voice is amplified by the refusal of the Democratic Party to disavow them.

Effectively, people like Nancy Pelosi have been offered a choice between preserving their own power and building the Democratic Party - and they've chosen the former. Pelosi and others of her ilk can afford to ""let 'em yap"" because it doesn't hurt *her* any. The people it hurts are the Senators/Representatives in other parts of the country - the Senators/Representatives the Democrats need to do anything on a national level but that Pelosi doesn't need to merely keep her job."
Kidneyjoe,And even if none of them did republicans would just lie and say they did. Their voters wouldn't know the difference.
Revydown,Maybe the Democrats needs to start calling those people out. The way I see it is that at least the Republicans are willing to call out their crazies. I hear so many attacks from the left that dont get much coverage outside their local area. Yet if a right winger makes an attack its national news.
ViskerRatio,"What I'm pointing out is that your version of ""political courage"" is more akin to ""political suicide""."
ViskerRatio,"> Because the Clinton example doesn’t make a lot of sense otherwise; Clinton’s speech was acknowledging the racist and bigoted elements of Trump’s base (which seems undeniable at this point),

That's a matter of opinion. What isn't a matter of opinion is that it's mind-bogglingly dumb for a politician to insult vast swathes of potential voters. It's like answering ""yes"" when your wife asks you if those jeans make her look fat. Whether or not you're right, you gave the wrong answer.

> I agree that Democrats need to expand outside of their progressive enclaves, but holding them accountable for dipshit 19yo Berkeley students just suggests to me that you’re grading on a curve – otherwise, you’d be holding Republicans equally responsible for the Steve Kings of the party (someone who, unlike Pelosi/Antifa or Duckworth/SNL, has actually been supported by the GOP instead of flatly denounced).

I was unaware that Steve King was participating in street riots. In any case, Steve King is a fairly obscure figure who doesn't really make national news.

> This reaffirms my suspicion that many of these complaints are coming from deeply, socially conservative viewpoints that are transfixed by culture wars and changing demographics, and no amount of moderation or bipartisan appeals to shared interests are going to eclipse the primal, irrational power of white identity politics.

It's not about bipartisan appeals to shared interests. It's about not shooting yourself in the foot by insulting people for no good reason."
S-A-M-K,I do not have the energy to try to argue every point but I’ll say this. I don’t feel like it’s the governments job to ensure equality or provide with better economic prospects. Also on the trans situation it’s not an extreme position to be tired of hearing about people who have a mental illness and make up less than 1 percent of the population. Trump isn’t going to legislate them out of existence lol. I hate that orange idiot but you are living in an alternate reality. No one cares what’s between anyone’s legs. Just want people to shut up about it and don’t make us pay for stuff with our tax dollars.
Cranyx,"Right, but my point is that when people say this, they seem to prefer a scenario where everyone ""meets in the middle."" I would argue that ""meeting in the middle"" can be wrong if one side is immoral."
Cranyx,"I would argue that mass incarceration (which includes slavery btw), thousands dying because they can't afford healthcare, child concentration camps, imperialist wars that kill thousands, and economic systems that keep millions in poverty are all pretty big."
Cranyx,If you believe that then you must believe that there is literally nothing worth fighting for. Almost 4 million human beings were being held in chattel slavery and were treated worse than animals. All rights had been stripped from them and they were constantly living in Hell. If any war would be justified it would be one of liberation. I'm sure as a white man Lincoln felt that it would be better to just let them suffer.

FuzzyBacon,"Essentially a default, among other things, would result in USD no longer being the global reserve currency, and would make our interest rates on new government debt *skyrocket*.

To give you an idea of the scope of how dumb defaulting is, right now almost every international business transaction occurs in or is secured by US dollars. This means that there is significant demand for our money outside of the country, which drives up the exchange rate (good for America, shitty for everyone else), and further incentives holding us government obligations for low-risk investments.

Defaulting is hands-down the dumbest single thing we could do, with the possible exception of a nuclear first-strike against North Korea. "
MrFrode,"I won't, no. This is something you can easily explore.

TheTruthMobile,"You want more for O'Malley? I got you. 

HB 987: the “rain tax"" 

&#x200B;

This tax is an annual fee on impervious surfaces such as roofs, driveways, sidewalks, garages, and any other surface that could create drainage problems and water contamination situated on property owned by an individual or a business. However, the tax is not applied to every city or county in the state. 

You think that's confusing? 

&#x200B;

Only nine counties (Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Charles, Frederick, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, and Prince George) and the city of Baltimore – out of twenty-four total counties in Maryland – are responsible not only for paying this fee, but their local officials must determine and set the dollar amount their constituents will pay. This leaves the aforementioned jurisdictions with 10 different “rain tax” rates. For example, Charles County levies a flat fee of $43 per property, while Montgomery County has fee rates ranging from $29.17 to $265.20 depending on size of impervious surfaces.

&#x200B;

Not only are the rates different for each, but so are the amount of square feet used to calculate the Equivalent Residential Unit and Impervious Unit: the unit of measurement to base the total fee per ERU or IU. One unit of ERU in the city of Baltimore is 1,050 sq. ft., while one ERU in Anne Arundel County is 2,940 sq. ft. Out of all the areas impacted by this fee, only two use the square footage amount per IU. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You want Gerrymandering? He's got that too.  

As the elected governor, I did my duty within the metes and bounds” of Maryland law that set up redistricting as a partisan exercise, O’Malley said last spring in a deposition. He added that if the reconfigured district “would be more likely to elect a Democrat than a Republican, yes, this was clearly my intent.” 

&#x200B;

When completed, the 6th District stretched from the state’s westernmost border across the panhandle before taking a sharp turn into Montgomery County, all the way down to about 10 miles from the White House. The 8th started in Takoma Park, on the border of the District of Columbia, and ran to the Pennsylvania border. - 

&#x200B;

 Martin O’Malley appointed the members of the redistricting committee and oversaw the 2011 redistricting effort. So in 2012, even though nearly 40 percent of the state’s registered voters are Republicans, seven out of eight seats in the House were filled by Democrats. (O’Malley was later deposed by attorneys in the Benisek case over his actions. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Maryland Democratic leaders defensively claim that they are “just evening the score a little bit”, as one of the few blue states that gerrymanders in a sea of red states that do. Effingham also explained that some legislators defend gerrymandering as “a point of leverage”, in that maybe by having blue gerrymandered state, it can be used to help “mutually disarm” all the red gerrymandered states. 

&#x200B;

I think America’s anti-immigrant mentality is pretty gross and very “un-American,” so to speak.

freejosephk,"I suppose you can say middle class moderates turn out to vote more than others but in a lot of places, that doesn't translate to democratic wins. Plus, the progressive point of view is a reasonable argument that wins middle class moderates over. And it's that same progressive voice that is bringing out a new and enthused generation of voters that in the hispanic south at least is bringing along their boomer parents who have always, since the 80's anyway, care a lot about healthcare. The progressive point of view also has the added benefit of bringing more voters to the party while keeping those moderates on our side.

How?   Most just seemed like naively principled idealists.   Some people are just too disgusted by ""normal"" candidates and want to vote for an indictment of ""the system.""    Weaponizing idealism is a pretty effective tactic.    To argue against it you have to get people to compromise, to vote for the ""lesser of two evils,"" etc.   And also the decades of GOP smear-jobs worked, and convinced many people at a  visceral level that Clinton was just dirty.    But no one wants to admit to themselves that they were suckered by conservative propaganda, so they just trusted their intuition rather than look critically at what was being said.    

>He’s just not politically popular outside of his niche group of white young suburbanites

Unfortunately that group can be pretty insular.   When you only talk to people who already agree with you, it can create the illusion that you have more consensus and momentum than you actually do. 

>He’s not a good candidate period.

I have to agree.   The ""angry guy"" may bring value to the table, but there has to be substance.   I just saw very little detail in his proposals.    Anger at ""the system,"" but not much else.    I'm still puzzled that anyone would think that a probable atheist self-described socialist who honeymooned in the Soviet Union would do well in the general election.   "
fireflash38,"I know just the type of person you're referring to. They almost always refer to Clinton as a criminal, and that she stole the election from Bernie. 

Did she have the benefit of the Democratic establishment working for her? Definitely. Did she steal it? No. Would Bernie have won the primary if the establishment didn't help her? No. 

It's just delusional to think he would have won the primary. And I say that as someone that voted for him in the primary. There was just no effing way that he was going to win the south. "

GuaranteedAdmission,"I also am brain dead from yesterday, so let me try this a different way:

* Sanders did far better than anyone would have predicted. The *why* isn't relevant here - he gave Clinton a much tighter race than anyone expected 

* It's hard to find a good historical match for the 2016 primaries, as most candidates in his position after Super Tuesday throw in the towel and endorse the frontrunner, which has the net effect of giving that nominee a mammoth vote total when everything is said and done. Example:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2000

So, the contest went on, which of course gave him a larger vote total than if he had conceded earlier 

That isn't to say that Sanders would automatically lose to Biden, because it's not going to be a two person race. Depending on how crowded each 'lane' is, Sanders or Biden could split the vote between like minded candidates and let the other take a commanding lead

However, back to the point: Sanders certainly did better than expected, but unless he can broaden his coalition, he doesn't command enough support to win the Democratic primary in a 1 to 1 contest against a Biden

(Unless you practise virtue ethics with a very unique combination of virtues)

Traditional GOP (Kasich, Bush, Flake) is dead, simply because their voter demographics is too small now.

>Would we be going by whichever way the fickle 5% of this country that still swings decides to do at the last minute come next election?

You were already doing that for decades. Radicals  (in this sense, I'm not talking about anarchists or whatever) usually start on the fringe, often by primarying the incumbents.

Forderz,Who the fucking is calling out Steve King?
comeherebob,"> I was unaware that Steve King was participating in street riots. In any case, Steve King is a fairly obscure figure who doesn't really make national news.

This is such a terrible equivalence. Steve King is an actual elected official who gets to decide our laws and is a supported member of the Republican party; idiot kids smashing windows have been denounced by Democratic party leadership and do not hold any government power. Hell, have you ever looked into rioters beyond quick cuts that political operatives like to tie to their opponents? Because, as a Democrat, I can guarantee you that groups like Antifa aren’t exactly supporters of the Democratic party. 

By using your own subjective standard of measurement (“I don’t hear much about Steve King, but I see a lot of street riots on the news!”), you’re setting up a ridiculous standard that is entirely dependent on whatever nakedly partisan, activist “news” outlets decide is the outrage du jour – and whatever they choose to bury.

> That's a matter of opinion.

Whether Clinton was accurate in her assessment is a matter of opinion; whether Clinton actually said what I said she did is *not* a “matter of opinion.” It’s fact. It happened. It’s documented.  

> It's about not shooting yourself in the foot by insulting people for no good reason.

Now this is a good example of a matter of opinion. Speaking to the legitimate concerns of minority voters is often conflated with “insulting people for no good reason.” We can’t control the hyper-sensitive, irrational fears of people who are THIS invested in culture wars, but we can try to rebuild a proven coalition of minorities, younger voters and working-class voters in the Rust Belt.

Nevoadomal,"The Civil War was not, at the outset, a war of liberation. It was a war, as all wars ultimately tend to be, for control of land and resources. All Lincoln demanded was that the South not break with America as America had once broken with Great Britain. If they agreed to that, slavery could stay. Of course, it is difficult to rally ongoing public support for a war for national power. Promising to ""liberate"" the oppressed sells much better, and by Gettysburg that was the main propaganda line. And of course it was a brilliant one, since it meant that slaves freed in lands won by the North could immediately be converted to willing conscripts in the fight against the South. And of course, after the war, ending slavery broke the economic backbone of the South, meaning it wouldn't be able to take another shot at it.

But of course, it was rather unfortunate for the freed slaves. It is one thing to be liberated because people recognize your inherent worth as a human being. But to liberated because those freeing you know that you will be worth much *less* as a freeman than a slave. Ouch. And of course that leads to a century more of racial oppression. "

Republicans need to take a long, hard look at themselves and ask why they've found so much electoral success by touting racist and xenophobic policies, and what that means about them. I do not think that even a sizeable minority of the party is willing to do that. Trump currently has about 90% approval from his party (it may drop a bit after the midterms, but with the wins in the Senate I think it's more likely to improve than decline), and the 10% of 'nevertrumpers' have no significant influence on the direction of the party. At this point the tumor has metastasized and like with normal cancer, the only path forward is hope that the toxicity of the medicine kills the disease before the host. "

EDIT: Nm, you're talking about  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Let me do some research on him; I'll hit you back in a bit."
capsaicinintheeyes,"I hadn't previously heard of AOC, but on broad strokes I wouldn't be so quick to say I'm moderate compared to her--looking at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez#Political_positions), I agree with her on most things, at least in a sort of vague, 10,000 foot level kind of way (not absolutely everything; just blanket-dismantling ICE has a kind of cheap, lazy red-meat feel to it that makes me kind of do a mental eye-roll). I was too lazy/preoccupied to go webcrawl for videotape of her, though (if you have one or two clips you think I should start with, I'd look at those if you link them; ideally, full enough to contextualize statements, but anything longer than 5, 8, maybe 10 minutes, I'd probably just spot-watch).   I saw a piece on her on reddit about a beef she had with some fox hosts who were suggesting she was hamming up her claimed rent issues to get ""working-class cred,"" but I don't feel familiar enough with her to judge how likely this is.  


Totally agree that Congressional Dems are and have pretty consistently been to the right of their base in aggregate, not always, but definitely noticeable at key times; the political center of gravity for Democratic politicians is perceptibly to the right of that of their core constituents, speaking broadly.  I want to restate your last paragraph to make sure I'm interpreting you properly:

&#x200B;

>You were already doing that for decades. Radicals (in this sense, I'm not talking about anarchists or whatever) usually start on the fringe, often by primarying the incumbents. Then, their rhetoric gets tacit acceptance, if not enthusiasm, from the rest. In 10 years, yesterday's radical becomes today's center. 

&#x200B;

""You"" = Democrats/voters on the left?  I agree that the Democratic party has clearly prioritized fighting for the 5% of swing voters over focusing on exiting their deep base to turn out in big numbers; the GOP seems to use a different formula, comparatively more weighted on getting core supporters engaged enough to vote at high rates (or at least that's been my takeaway).  I agree that on both sides, candidates so far from the center they stand out compared to the incumbents currently in office get in the door during primaries, while more establishment Dems and Repubs often have eyes toward the general from the word ""go.""  I'm not sure if you had a larger point here, but I agree with you on everything I've said here, assuming I have you right.

&#x200B;

I said:

>Would we be going by whichever way the fickle 5% of this country that still swings decides to do at the last minute come next election?, cuz I don't consider those guys to be political sages. 

I say this the way I did because I suspect these are more likely to be low-information types easily persuaded by mood and/or whoever's ad had the best theme music or pithiest rhyming slogan in the last news cycle before the election, *not* a bunch of supernerds who agonize over every nuance and caveat until the very last second.  My ass--if one in a hundred ""last-minute undecideds"" are in that second group, I'll be looking into non-toxic hat materials so I know what kind to buy before I eat it.

So I don't think how they come down ties in very tightly with who would have been the better candidate.  It's important politically, of course, but only because they're the only ones parties can gain or lose ground on.  I suspect the core GOP base would howl ""terrorist marxist dicator unprecedented worst most unhinged ever"" at whoever the Dems put up and whatever they do in office, and lockstep oppose on everything.  A dependable & engaged conservative would probably say ""that's almost right, capsaicin, you just need to reverse which party it is that does that, and you'd be on point.""  Those voters aren't ""capturable,"" they only change in terms of turnout rates, and that's based on what they perceive as happening, not directly on what's objective or quantifiably going on.  So I predict Trump's core will be horrified by the Democratic house, *and would be no matter what they did,* and that Trump and McConnell have so poisoned the process with their outrageous tactics, terrible proposals, etc., and are so unlikely to change in that refard, that Democrats will never be convinced to switch to GOP in any conceivable scenario.  Likewise for Trump-voting ""independents"" and Hillary-voting ""independents.""  (for the record, I identify as ""independent,"" but I hope you know enough about me from reading along with me this far that you don't think I consider GOP v. Dems a coin-toss type decision).  And I'm guessing a great many conservatives would say that to whatever extent their party does play hardball, it's to push back against the underhanded tactics the Democrats use, and that what Democrats are almost certainly going to do in office is going to be so alien and anathema to just and sound policy as we see them that asking us not to oppose them as a gesture of camaraderie would amount to us standing by, as the major check on bad actors and ideas, and knowingly watch the left do things that will wreck people's lives on a huge scale and may even harm the country so badly we never come back from it.

>The Associated Press reports that King ultimately beat Democratic newcomer J.D. Scholten, despite condemnation from his own party over his support of white supremacist groups and leaders.

>King has come under increasing scrutiny for his inflammatory rhetoric on race and immigration as well as what critics say is his embrace of white nationalism. He was favored to win reelection, although his recent actions — including his endorsement of a white nationalist candidate for Toronto mayor and his meeting with members of a far-right Austrian party with historical Nazi ties — earned him rebukes from the Anti-Defamation League, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) and others.

If Kavanaugh was such a big issue for Democrats then why wasnt Bob Menendez outed? The allegations against Kavanaugh went back 30 years and there was little to no collaborating evidence against him outside of he said she said.

https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/nov/6/senate-reports-paints-devastating-profile-justice-/

Then you are hearing some stories that some of his allegations were completely made up or had to back track. 

Then there is Keith Ellison that wins the race after the abuse scandal.

https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/07/politics/minnesota-attorney-general-keith-ellison/index.html

I'm holding the Democrats to a higher standard because they were the ones these kind of items were a big issue for. The thing is, where was the outrage from the left against Menendez? Then if Kavanaugh was so important why isnt there still outrage and protests against him after his confirmation?

I on the other hand believe innocent until proven guilty."
ViskerRatio,"> By using your own subjective standard of measurement (“I don’t hear much about Steve King, but I see a lot of street riots on the news!”), you’re setting up a ridiculous standard that is entirely dependent on whatever nakedly partisan, activist “news” outlets decide is the outrage du jour – and whatever they choose to bury.

> Speaking to the legitimate concerns of minority voters is often conflated with “insulting people for no good reason.” 

Consider Black Lives Matter. This is a perfect example of how to address an issue in the most idiotic way possible.

Let's say you're concerned with police violence. But let's assume you're really, really horrible at politics. How would you address it? Well, you'd highly publicize cases where the 'victim' was actually the 'perpetrator'. You'd narrowly focus on a specific identity group as much as possible so all other identity groups would view it either as an attack on them or an issue not of their concern. You'd publicize your cause by extremely disruptive and unfocused activities that had no direct relationship to your actual issue. You'd ignore niceties like establishing policy goals or metrics for success in favor of simply engaging in random outrage.

In other words, you'd do exactly what Black Lives Matter ended up doing. It's a great scheme if you're planning to pay your rent as a professional activist. It's a horrible scheme if you plan on actually creating positive social change.

But we're not at the table. We don't get to bargain, we don't get to advocate ourselves. We only have our representatives. 

Now compromise I'm fine with, but compromise needs to be thoughtful. It needs to actually be a compromise, not a capitulation, and not an all around payday with little to show for it. And because I can't be there to object to bad compromises, the one thing I don't want to compromise on in a candidate is the sense that they will walk away from a bad deal.

FuzzyBacon,"The economy is starting to stumble, FYI. I'm not blaming Trump and the Republicans for that, it's how the business cycle works - we've had a decade of uninterrupted growth and it can't continue forever.

What I can blame them for, though, is lighting many of our tools to deal with the coming downturn on fire. Their tax cut poured gasoline on an overheated economy and caused some short term stimulus, but it means that tax cuts are simply impossible next time we're in an actual recession and *need* to stimulate the economy. Similarly, their repeal of financial regulations and kneecapping the cfpb mean that consumers are getting screwed and banks are over leveraging *again*, which means they'll be whining and demanding more bailouts when their loose lending policies inevitably bite them in the ass. And we'll have to pay them, because if they go down so does the world's economy. "

The fact is it can exist and my comment is just stating that and not a notion that it is a popular or common position. You're conflating two different concepts by your statements.

usered77,"I don't know what study you are quoting from but the fact that 50% of minorities sensing that they were victim of racism is a huge deal.

Also, where there are less minority population and higher number of non-college educated whites, people tend to be more xenophobic and conservative. They might not interact much with people of color, but they can still harbor racism against them.

Florida's white retiree migrants are the congregation of such folks. They love Hannity and Fox News, worship Trump, and mutter n-word when black people are not around (or even when they are around). The fact that they are more affluent than others make them even less prone to support Democrats, when Democrats try on  every platform to woo them.

The rural Midwest is more persuadable than Florida through appeals regarding labor. However, their increasing tendency to support Republicans do not stem from their economic desperation. For example, union leaders who are Democratic indeed whine about Democrats not reaching enough to them but they experience greater frustration by their own members who support Democratic economic agenda but end up voting for Reps because of guns and racism. Though the Midwest experienced a blue wave this year, it is apparent that it is getting redder. Even Sherrod Brown, a populist whom Berniecrats tend to like, is slowly decreasing his base. His margin of 6 points, though an accomplishment in an increasingly red state, is a little underwhelming as his Republican opponent was underfunded and other states experience blue wave."

That NYT is considered a leftist activist outlet despite employing people like Bari Weiss, David Brooks, and running sympathetic profile after sympathetic profile of Trump voters is kind of proving my point here.

If a candidate takes a break from hammering talking points about everybody's healthcare to say, “let’s talk about why black women have higher childbirth mortality rates than any other group, and what we can do to fix it” and you hear “white men are evil,” then the problem is yours, not the candidate’s.

GigaTortoise,"> I'm sorry, but how much more successful can they possibly be?

If they had black+hispanic+muslim voters in their corner there would be no talk of flipping any southern states at all. There would be more swing states for Republicans, etc

If they had stuck with the originally Republican ACA plan and a public option then they would have white suburban voters who care a lot about healthcare. (Of course Obama did well there in a futile effort of bipartisanship that turned market based universal healthcare into a liberal idea instead of a conservative one).

Republicans would also benefit in a soft way from winning the popular vote. While I am personally a federalist, lots of people think that nationally popular vote is the only thing that should matter which makes Republicans look weak now since they only have wider geographical appeal instead of sheer numbers

> Ignoring minorities and turning out the racist white vote is a winning strategy for them.

I would argue it's a winning strategy only because they were already loosely coupled with racists, and the 2016 election + Trump simply capitalized on that by ensuring that every single racist person would be unequivocably Republican in voting.

Also I think this is only looking at success from a short term perspective. It's likely that the Republicans will hold the Senate for the forseeable future, yes, but even though racists fully consolidated their vote under Trump, America is still getting less prejudiced over time. I don't know how they can do it, but Republicans Senate advantage should be seen as an extended opportunity to start building a new coalition for the long term."

Squalleke123,"> However, their increasing tendency to support Republicans do not stem from their economic desperation. For example, union leaders who are Democratic indeed whine about Democrats not reaching enough to them but they experience greater frustration by their own members who support Democratic economic agenda but end up voting for Reps because of guns and racism.

I think you're wrong here, simply because a similar thing is seen world-wide, including Countries where racism is not an issue because there are no minorities (like Poland) and countries where guns are not an issue (UK for example).

The thing is, and union leaders realize this as well, the third way left-wingers (Clinton for the US, Blair for the UK, ...) have adopted right-wing economic policies that have allowed jobs to be outsourced and social security to get hollowed out. The democrats in the US simply have not had a coherent pro-labor policy for twenty years now. Choosing between them and republicans has become a choice between cholera and plague for the blue collars.

You have to look at the 2016 election (or the brexit referendum) in that light. They got a choice between the evil they knew (Clinton policies) and the evil they didn't know (Trump). And they took the chance to make it clear that they didn't like the evil they know.

I think, at this point, the democrat's third way strategy, even if succesful at first, is starting to bite them in the ass. They lost a huge deal of credibility with their traditional base, and their new voters push them in a direction even further away from that traditional base with policies directed at minorities."

Left_of_Center2011,"We buy our oil in dollars, yes - but groups from other countries *also* buy their oil in dollars (at least when they are buying from an OPEC country) which leads to a constant demand for dollars all over the world. That fact is a big part of why American debt is the reserve currency of the world."
FuzzyBacon,"It's a bit of a chicken-egg question as to why they're traded in USD. The biggest reason is stability - the US is typically pretty good about controlling their inflation, and the size of our economy means that no matter what, you'll be able to find something to spend those dollars on without having to convert them (and thus almost certainly incurring a loss on translation). This means that there's little risk in having a bunch of dollars on hand because the value isn't likely to fluctuate much even over moderate time periods (3-5 years). Whether this is true because of being the global reserve currency (at least in part), or if we are the global reserve because of this, is harder to identify and frankly not particularly important.

As for 'don't we get the oil from them', that's correct, but the factor you have glossed over is that everyone else also buys oil using USD. Because the supply of dollars is relatively stable (low inflation), this means that every nation needs enough dollars on hand to buy their oil, which drives up the demand for our currency. It's a big part of why Americans can vacation overseas more affordably than citizens of say, Canada. If we go somewhere else and pay in local currency, we likely 'traded up' to get that money, while citizens with less valuable currency may have had to trade down. "

If ICE were a person, they'd be getting their driver's license right now. A long-standing institution they are not.

That being said, long-term cap gains should be taxed favorably compared to earned income, although not *as* favorably as they are right now (rates are about 15% lower than ordinary income in all brackets). Right now short-term gains are taxed the same as ordinary income, and in order to promote stability and disincentivize reinvesting every few months to maximize gains, you get to save some on your taxes if you're willing to park your money for a year+. This means that businesses can more reliably access investment capital and trust that it will not dry up at the drop of a hat.

I'm not sure what the ideal rate would be, but for starters we should add more brackets to allow for more granular adjustments to the effective tax rate. "

If your only concern is that some people might get more than one degree, I'm pretty sure every single advocate of tuition free higher ed would be fine limiting it to one or two undergrad degrees. Or maybe one undergrad and one masters.

There aren't many gender studies students to begin with. US higher education institutions grant around 2700 degrees per year in women's studies, for example. To put this in perspective, it grants ~233,000 nursing degrees and ~181,000 engineering degrees. But if this is genuinely your concern, I seriously doubt the folks wanting tuition free higher education would balk at a deal making it tuition free for a single undergraduate degree in a set of in-demand fields identified yearly by the department of labor or something."

My point is exactly what I said it was: Democrats had a winning formula at one time by building a coalition of minority and youth voters, plus working class voters in the Midwest and North. Given the gains made in those areas last night with those voters, this still seems like a viable strategy, but not if Democrats abandon minorities or younger voters because they're too scared of Rush Limbaugh or Tucker Carlson to speak directly to those groups' concerns.

Hearing direct appeals to those groups as ""white men are evil"" is indeed irrational (and has nothing to do with the traditional definition of conservatism in the US, by the way). Sorry if that opinion offends some people, but I'm not very politically correct and prefer to state things plainly instead of sugarcoating them.

> What you're claiming is that the NYT, Post and CNN are merely dupes for some sort of rightwing extremists. Aside from being well into conspiracy theory territory

How is this a ""conspiracy theory""? When journalists are concerned with ""hearing both sides"" rather than sussing out the middle ground, it's a lot easier to play the refs. That doesn't require any coordinated effort or grand secret, it just involves hollering about bias as loudly and as often as you can. Given that most of the outlets you listed treated a bedraggled caravan from Honduras as a legitimate concern for people in Oklahoma, I'd say it's less a ""conspiracy"" and more of a tactic that has proven decently effective."

It's completely unmoored from reality, of course, but as a lie to score cheap political points, it's quite solid. 

The reality is that Democrats were perfectly willing to negotiate on immigration with Republicans, including harsher restrictions and even being willing to concede to a wall-adjacent solution (aka smart use of fencing and walls in appropriate areas, not a 40-foot fuckoff wall that crosses hundreds of miles of inhospitable terrain and violates treaties with Mexico). They went to the table with this because they wanted a solution to the Dreamer problem. Republicans turned around and not only yanked helping dreamers from the deal, they also tried to tighten restrictions on legal immigration to reduce it by half. Understandably, Democrats walked, because it wasn't a compromise being offered anymore, it was complete capitulation.

>>How many useless degrees are taxpayers supposed to fund?

>If your only concern is that some people might get more than one degree, I'm pretty sure every single advocate of tuition free higher ed would be fine limiting it to one or two undergrad degrees. Or maybe one undergrad and one masters.

You misunderstood. I'm talking total numbers across the board. When people aren't paying for it themselves, they have less incentive to pick a major that would near guarantee them a job.


>There aren't many gender studies students to begin with. US higher education institutions grant around 2700 degrees per year in women's studies, for example. To put this in perspective, it grants ~233,000 nursing degrees and ~181,000 engineering degrees

Yes... Because people actually have to make a decision based on the amount they are paying for the degree. Since gender studies doesn't net a job most of the time, we only get 2700 idiots per year that study it. If one didn't *need* to get a job, because everybody else was forced to pay for their stupid ""degree"" you would see an increase in that number. 

> I seriously doubt the folks wanting tuition free higher education would balk at a deal making it tuition free for a single undergraduate degree in a set of in-demand fields identified yearly by the department of labor or something.

FuzzyBacon,"It's not so much that we wouldn't be able to lend money to other people so much as other people would be less interested in securing our borrowing.

Think of it like this - if you want to buy a car, odds are that you'll need to finance that purchase. If you've got a good history of repaying your debts, then you shouldn't have an issue finding a bank to lend you that money at a reasonable interest rate. This is more or less where we're at now.

Now that you've gotten that loan, though,  how do you think lenders would react if you decided to run off into the woods with the vehicle and stop making payments? For starters, they'd repo the car (if they can find it), and they'd report your delinquency to credit reporting agencies, so that whenever you go to get another loan the loaner can see that your payment history is spotty. So in order to mitigate the risk, they're going to charge you higher interest rates.

By defaulting, we're essentially running off into the woods. And the world would react accordingly and price out batshit politics into their debt buying decisions. Right now, us t-bills are effectively zero risk, and as such they command a very low interest rate (often below inflation), meaning that they're a good store of value but not a profitable investment. Defaulting would not only end the zero-risk treatment, it would also send shockwaves rippling around the world as other governments who own billions of dollars in those bonds now have to unfuck their balance sheets.

The Republicans on the other hand have abandoned just about everything except Tax Cuts and White Conservative Christianity = Good; All Else = Bad. For many Republicans there are no ideals only dogma.

I'm looking for a pragmatic fiscally middle to conservative party that is also cautious of sudden societal changes.

JustAnotherSimpleton,"> No, because they wouldn't be paying for their degree under that system, they would be getting taxed to pay for everybody else's degrees. 

They'd be paying into the higher education system that they earned a degree within. That's payment for the service they benefited from. It becomes an indirect public service than some sort of individual account, but that's just a matter of how you do the accounting.

> You misunderstood. I'm talking total numbers across the board.

As long as the individual rate is not excessive, it wouldn't be a problem as a whole.

> Because people actually have to make a decision based on the amount they are paying for the degree.

That's not really how the psychology or the economics of college are functioning. People just major in whatever they want to do, then take loans to pay for it.

> Since gender studies doesn't net a job most of the time, we only get 2700 idiots per year that study it.

The actual reason is that it isn't very interesting, isn't very popular, and isn't very well regarded by much of anybody. That's why there's such small numbers of students graduating from said programs.

People can self-select majors just fine, regardless of how the accounting works out. Even if we made college tuition free, it seems highly unlikely that very many additional students would opt to major in women's studies or gender studies or the like.

> If one didn't need to get a job

This doesn't make a lot of sense as a premise. Tuition free college doesn't remove the incentive to work--or the need to have a job after graduation--it just makes the financing of how you pay for college less painful and disruptive since you pay for it at a time in your life where you're better able to afford it.

> Makes even less sense. The market already results in paying the in-demand fields good money.

Your primary concern seems to be the notion that lots of people would use this as an excuse to get useless degrees. Only covering tuition for degrees that are in demand would be an obvious way to prevent that outcome.

The ""market economics"" of college degrees breaks down for a whole host of reasons--young people aren't particularly good at long term planning, there's loads of marketing effort being spent to confuse students about likely outcomes, different degrees can have wildly different difficulties and requirements, and the job market itself can often shift around a fair bit before people complete a lengthy program. 

It doesn't really work like you're describing it. For example, there are more people in business school than in nursing or engineering, despite career prospects being way better for nurses and engineers."

Agreed. It was also given oxygen by a president and his party who (correctly) saw it as an effective way to rile up fear and resentment.

Arguing the wording and whether it's an official plank or not seems disingenuous or at least superfluous.  This is the discussion and the maneuvers aren't about right and wrong they're about pandering to the Latin American / illegal vote.  What? Illegals can't vote?  No, but their American family members and second generation kids with citizenship can and playing up the racism card lets them use the border issue as 'racism lite' when attacking their opponents.

The GOP could be racist as fuck and it would still not change the part where Democrats are pushing open borders and it's not even below the surface, just not as wide open as the entire party openly advocating for it using that specific term.

I'm nearly certain the arguments being had here are less about open borders and more about team politics.  The borders need to be secure and bullshitting around with them in a damned serious manner for votes is a shitty idea.  That's all."
FuzzyBacon,"Yes, that was the discussion that Democrats wanted to have. Republicans wanted to close the border and then do nothing about the dreamers - why on earth do you expect Democrats to cede ground and get nothing in return? You could argue that Republicans wanted to close the border first and deal with dreamers after, but for one they've proven themselves to be dishonest agents time and again, and for another, on what planet is 'give us everything we want and we promise we'll take a look at your concerns down the line' a viable bargaining position? 

The reason these talk go nowhere is because Republicans have a toxic mindset that makes it impossible to even begin negotiations, because their starting point is 'we get everything and you get nothing' and then they work from there to try to inflict more pain on their opposition. That is not healthy and there's a reason that this rhetoric and these tactics have led to the current impasse. Republicans seem more interested in punishing their opposition than in actually addressing the problem. "
riggmislune,"Interesting perspective, I’m not necessarily convinced Democrats will be happier with where they are in 5 years. 

Namely, the suburban voters that are turned off by the current GOP do not share the Democrats support for higher taxes and redistribution of wealth. Those voters were the rural voters that are strongly in the GOP camp now. The tension between these “Democrats” who mostly want to stay the course with a slightly less harsh tone towards immigrants and the hard left will be a delicate tightrope to walk. The Democrats won’t be able to have a full throated endorsement of social issues (or risk minorities not turning out) or a full throated endorsement of left wing economics (or risk pushing suburbanites to the GOP). 

Meanwhile, the GOP only needs to bring the suburbanites back - this could be as easy as changing the messaging on immigration (“fair but high standards”) or trying to reinstate SALT deductions."
Flewtea,"Exactly. I don't think he's going to leave office and suddenly everyone that's been vehemently supporting his policies is going to suddenly do an about face or anything close to it on immigration, trade, or even opinions on the media. Someone else will come forward to carry that banner."
RareMajority,"Trump created the blatantly racist birther movement. He regularly insults black politicians, calling them ""unintelligent"" or ""low IQ"". He endorses politicians who are actively disenfranchising blacks (Brian Kemp), he attacks the Black Lives Matter movement, without saying anything at all about the disproportionate amount of violence that law enforcement inflicts on the black community. Tell me again what part of trump's actions, words, or policies are supposed to be appealing to the black community?"
PotentialFortune5,"Illegals are not people like you and me, we haven't invaded a country robbing it and undermining it's political structure, they have 0 good about them it's one of the things I disagree with the president over when he said some were fine people.

No your feels before reals, muh want a better life so our laws don't matter. Hey I want a couple thousand dollars if I really want to can I rob a bank and not be punished?

It's not radical to recognize an invasion for what it is, undermining the law and refusing to recognize them as an invasion until they hit a terminal mass then you make them citizens and reward them and then smugly smile about it all while chanting demographics is destiny for elections.

Those who lie on their visa applications by overstaying have shown they lack any moral character and are no different than a rapist or a cannibal."

There are dozens of us! DOZENS!
"
Cranyx,"> We are talking about so highly a polarized landscape that even issues like nuclear energy might become gridlocked because of partisanship.

But that's a made up point that doesn't exist. There is no gridlock over nuclear energy because of how ""polarized"" we are.

>Supporting the right to bear arms does not explicitly harm anyone.

Sure the right itself doesn't hurt anyone, but that's a pedantic point if I've ever heard one."
Sa_Rart,"He's saying that people will answer untruthfully when asked for a poll that they will vote Trump, since they dislike admitting otherwise to the poll worker, but will vote against him in the booth, where the answer is undisclosed.

I don't know that the data supports that happening, but the statement is free from logical fallacy, even if it isn't true."
daviddavidson29,"If that is truly the democrats' stance (close the border + amnesty for a portion of illegal immigrants), and they are willing to actually stop illegal immigration, I mean actually stop it by both border crossings and expired visa deportations, AND they are willing to agree to *no* future amnesty deals (the only way to make this one work), then I don't see how talks don't restart now that we have a mixed congress. "
Founders_Pride,"Republicans didn't want to make an Amnesty deal with the democrats because they did that back in the 80s with the 1986 Amnesty bill, but they didn't hold up to their side of the bargain, and our immigration is still a complete mess."
Squalleke123,"> Trump created the blatantly racist birther movement.

Nope, he coopted it. It started during the DNC primaries in 2008 or even earlier, so way before Trump decided to run as a republican.

>He regularly insults black politicians, calling them ""unintelligent"" or ""low IQ"".

He does the same with non-black politicians, and foreign state leaders...

Literally every single thing you list here is Trump making a remark on a black individual and YOU generalizing them for all blacks. As I said above, he hasn't done anything for them as a group yet, but he hasn't fucked them over as a group neither. It's not gonna be easy to get them to become republican voters, but I don't think it's impossible neither if Trump plays his cards right."
JustAnotherSimpleton,"> Illegals are not people like you and me,

Yes, they are. People *just* like you or me.

> No your feels before reals

You've consistently cranked the hyperbole up to 11, and insist on using loaded terms and emotionally charged language to misrepresent the situation. Your only response is ""nuh uh, you are!""

> It's not radical to recognize an invasion for what it is

It becomes radical when you start pretending there's an ""invasion"" when there isn't, and basing your politics on that."
UnstuckClimatologist,"It's like saying you can't kill someone with a gun because ""I didn't lay a finger on her!"""
Wierd_Carissa,"I'm imagining a poll occurring, instead, online or over the phone... as most polls are conducted this way. But even if it is occurring in front of a poll worker, it's far from being revealed publicly like he or she said, right? This is almost certainly a stranger, and word does not get out about their answer. "
FuzzyBacon,"They don't want to 'close' the border so much as enforce existing immigration law. Closing also implies ending or at least severely curtailing legal immigration, and you won't see Democrats back that.

That being said, I wouldn't be at all surprised if an immigration bill that addresses both the border and dreamers ends up in the Senate for McConnell to do nothing with sometime around June. It wouldn't the the first time the senate killed amnesty for dreamers - the reason the limbo exists at all is because the Republicans in the senate wouldn't allow the bill to the floor for a vote, necessitating an executive order as a stopgap. "
PotentialFortune5,"No they aren't, they are invaders who've come to rob this nation blind under the whiny guise of their problems.

It is not emotionally charged language to call a spade a spade.

There is an invasion we are occupied by 20 million foreign nationals living to undermine every institution of the state with their very breath. We have seen them divide the nation and turn areas that were once America into degenerate areas"
daviddavidson29,"""Close"" probably isn't the best term, you're right.  But existing laws obviously aren't good enough when you have 11M + illegal immigrants in the country, so something has to change in order for amnesty to be reasonable.  The ""chain migration"" issue has been brought up.  Is that something that could be changed or reduced?"
FuzzyBacon,"Chain migration is incredibly overblown. If you base your understanding on the rhetoric coming from Trump about chain migration, you'd get the impression that once one person has citizenship, the rest of their family gets guaranteed visas the next day. In reality, the visa application process even with a family member sponsoring you takes a *minimum* of two years on the wait list after the application is approved (which itself takes 3-6 months). The average time is between 10 and 24 years depending on the relationship (parents and children take less time, siblings take the longest). [source](https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/us-immigration/how-long-sponsor-family-member-green-card.html) 

In other words, it's not a problem, it's a red herring. That being said, if further curtailing family green card sponsorship is one of the demands, I don't anticipate Democrats pushing back too hard on it provided that the rest of thr solution adequately addresses their concerns. "
daviddavidson29,So if a deal like this gets struck by leadership on both sides..... do they fight over who gets to claim credit for it?  Isn't it 4 to 5 million votes they would be playing tug-of-war with? 
FuzzyBacon,"Objectively, amnesty bit Republicans in the ass after Reagan, which is why I think a lot of Republicans aren't really interested in solving the problem. They want to ramp up the fear and discourage minorities from voting, not create new minority voting blocs. They know that their rhetoric has essentially lost them the Latino vote and because the short term gain of new voters thankful for their legal status won't last beyond an election cycle or two, and I don't think any immigration bill that could garner the support of Republican leadership could come close to getting through the house.

But in the magical Christmas land where bipartisan immigration reform happens, I think both sides more or less refuse to acknowledge that the other side played a role and attempt to take all the credit themselves. "
